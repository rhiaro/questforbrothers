Idea?

QfB is narrated from the second person perspective of a semi-omniscient being in the present tense.

How to decide what you know?  Incomplete knowledge of history of the planet etc.  Is the narrator a significant part of the story or not?  Is the narrator some essence of the planet itself?  I think no, because then it would know too much.

Why is the narrator focusing on these three characters?  Does it matter?  If not, why not?

Some eternal flying being, or essence of the sky or air?  Perspectives from above for describing locations is good.  Air means that a point of view from anywhere is possible.

Can the narrator influence the actions of Suari, Jackann and Tug?  Or poke and prod, or otherwise set actions in motion in some way?  Perhaps using nature.

Narrator is one or all of the 'post-humans' who have ascended.  The ones who haven't are the deities that masquarade in various forms around the world.  The post-humans (need a name) need Durk, Lark and either one of Suari's brothers or (twist) Suari for something.  They were born special.  How many others are there?  The narrator knows Jackann, Tug and Suari will hinder by trying to track down their kin, and have to stop them.  Need to get Lark, Durk and t'other into the Chasm.

I think Durk might join Jackann in Tanton somewhere, before they descend into the Chasm together.

Lark is ascended, I guess, successfully, before Jackann can save him.  Durk knows by this point that someone is after him, and tells Jackann what he knows.  Durk escaped when Lark did not, perhaps.

Lark can come face to face with the narrator, after he has ascended.

Ooh, maybe Suari has a long lost twin who is actually the one.  A brother twin.  Who was lost/sacrificed at birth.  Her quest for a brother is one she doens't even know herself...
