# Past

Idea?

QfB is narrated from the second person perspective of a semi-omniscient being in the present tense.

How to decide what you know?  Incomplete knowledge of history of the planet etc.  Is the narrator a significant part of the story or not?  Is the narrator some essence of the planet itself?  I think no, because then it would know too much.

Why is the narrator focusing on these three characters?  Does it matter?  If not, why not?

Some eternal flying being, or essence of the sky or air?  Perspectives from above for describing locations is good.  Air means that a point of view from anywhere is possible.

Can the narrator influence the actions of Suari, Jackann and Tug?  Or poke and prod, or otherwise set actions in motion in some way?  Perhaps using nature.

Narrator is one or all of the 'post-humans' who have ascended.  The ones who haven't are the deities that masquarade in various forms around the world.  The post-humans (need a name) need Durk, Lark and either one of Suari's brothers or (twist) Suari for something.  They were born special.  How many others are there?  The narrator knows Jackann, Tug and Suari will hinder by trying to track down their kin, and have to stop them.  Need to get Lark, Durk and t'other into the Chasm.

I think Durk might join Jackann in Tanton somewhere, before they descend into the Chasm together.

Lark is ascended, I guess, successfully, before Jackann can save him.  Durk knows by this point that someone is after him, and tells Jackann what he knows.  Durk escaped when Lark did not, perhaps.

Lark can come face to face with the narrator, after he has ascended.

Ooh, maybe Suari has a long lost twin who is actually the one.  A brother twin.  Who was lost/sacrificed at birth.  Her quest for a brother is one she doens't even know herself...

Jackann's earthling/wastelander, S'dhor? Sdhor? Sdhora? Sollorha? S'hollora? (She needs at least two names though)

She meets him near athe beginning of his journey, and joins him under some pretext; she's of the west and travelling east for reasosn similar to his - to find a lost family.

But really she's of the Waste, in some way mutated or affected by the Source radiation having been born there. She's returning to her people. Why was she in the west? Stealing something / knowledge from Tanton City?

Suari ends up living/working at a rural/farmhouse like place. Monestary? Refuge of some living gods? Probably in a sudden large oasis after she's on her last leg in the desert having escaped Mntrnao. She resigns herself to that for a while, having matured/continuing to mature and learning about life.

Maybe her contemplation is interrupted by one of her brothers and his followers turning up having been driven out by her other brother.

Maybe Tug joins her there too and they go back to the city rather than meeting in the city. Or maybe she does meet Tug in the city and they are separated and Tug goes into the ravine. I need to think on Tug's journey and goals more.

Tug is searching for her brother who she believes to be in Tanton City. He's after escape from the confines of ice-bound sightless life, and heard of technologies and freedoms of Tanton. So Tug tries to head east then south on her brother's trail, but is taken - kidnapped by pirates? - and sailed west then south to the barely-Tantonian islands. On the voyage, sightless, clueless and imprisoned she sustains a connection with nature/earth/world, inkeeping with the beliefs of her people.

Perhaps Suari's gods are manifestations of this same aspect.

Whatever happens to Jackann's fathers party, Lark is taken by the world/nature. Things are strange under the influence of the Source..

Maybe we see what happens to Lark through Tug's 'eyes'.

Lark becomes distributed, incorporeal. He can see - including his brother's search for him - through trees and clouds and rocks etc. But can't communicate. He and Tug can connect through this.

When Jackann figures out how to extract Lark, the results are disasterous. A monstrous, mutated, unrecognisable creature with Lark inside.

Their father is a.. geographical philosopher? Scholar of theography? His research indicates a sentience of nature and the world, inline with Tug's peoples' beliefs. He thinks the Source problems creeping ever closer to Tanton City can be neutralised if this is better understood, and whatever the religioius attitudes of Tantonians are (undecided; one god? diverse communities? atheism? nothing? indifference? worship of technology?) change. He didn't think to go north to find a culture already in harmony with his findings, which Jackann realises after encountering Tug.

Maybe ditch the second person narrator. Maybe keep writing for now to fill in context gaps and work out later.. kinda derp.

Post-humans stuff is also stupid.

Ages ago I decided S'hollora should have a parasitic twin, and is grossly deformed underneath her baggy clothes. Can't find where I wrote that down.

ALIENS.

Hear me out.

I wanted some overall meaning for this story.. some purpose, some point. I knew the three POVCs are connected and called together but WHY?

It's definitely aliens.

The second person narrator is Lark. At some point it's a combination of Lark, Durk and Suari's brother. But at the beginning at least it's Lark (because he's the bro we get to know the best). Time isn't a thing, or moves differently for them.

Maybe millions and millions of years ago, some alien thing crashed into the planet. It was buried deep. Leaking radiation from the bulk of the crash is to blame for the Source. That's also why the Sourcelands are the epicentre of the story, where Jackann, Tug and Suari are ultimately called to. Parts of whatever crashed were scattered too, all around the planet.

Something lives in the center of the crash. We'll say the remains of the 'ship' for now. They've been waking up and trying to work out what happened, fix things, save themselves. They're piecing broken things back together, routing power past broken conduits, etc. Bypassing some security protocols. It's taken them a while to come around, work out what's broken, and start a strategy to repair it so they can escape. Millions and millions of years, in fact. But as far as they're concerned, they just crashed. They're working at a pace normal to them, separate from the growth and evolution of the planet they crashed on. They can be non-corporeal, integrated with the technology that serves them, existing at a totally different level to the rest of the planet.

Some part of their psychic or technical circuitry made its way to Lark, Durk and Suari's brother. A lifetime of conditioning to drive them towards the Sourcelands is actually a result of a switch in an algorithm to repair the crashed ship.

(Maybe there are others than the three.. I'm not sure yet.)

The Survivor can manipulate generations of beings on the planet through fleeting moments of hacking at code, and they don't even know what they're doing. The crashed ship and the Survivor have been integrated throughout the entire planet's history. The evolution of every group of organisms is connected with it. Durk, Lark and Suari's brother are just flipped bits in the grand scheme of things.

Thus Lark's narration transcends the chronology of the story. Lark is already part of the machine, before he's even born. The narration is the integration of his Tantonian, corporeal perspective with the totally detached omnipresent existence of the Survivor and their system. Lark the narrator is making sure Lark the boy is making his way to the Sourcelands so he can become Lark the narrator. So the program runs okay.

Maybe the trio have to stop the ship from leaving eventually because it'll tear the planet apart. But how to reconcile that with the infinite timelessness of the Survivor? Maybe the Survivor becomes conscious of the teeny tiny beings in their code and decides to stay. Maybe neither side is aware of the other.

------

Nika has a tragic past. Jackann never takes the time to get to know her. But right before he's going to flee after Lark and the Prof he goes to the bird tower to send one last message to Suari and Nika is there, thinking about jumping. He takes her with him. Slowly he learns how she was abused by her father and brothers. She puts on a lighthearted front, but she never had any close friends. She becomes devoted to her little troupe of travellers as it grows on the way to the Sourcelands. She probably dies defending them. She may make eyes at S'hollara at some point.

------

Jackann and S'hollara (and Nika) pick up other waifs and strays along their way. 

A small child definitely dies from an allergic reaction to bee/wasp stings, after they accidentally disturb a nest in the woods and endure a horrifying chase by an angry swarm.

Tragic things happen until only Jackann and S'hollara make it to the Sourcelands. Not sure if S'hollara is in any way responsible for this.

I think her betrayal might be less deep. She definitely betrays Jackann.. but she isn't in league with the Survivor. Not explicitly, at least.

* google what the ends of the grand canyon look like.. need to figure out the White Sea.
* After reading Broken Earth I think I can handle present tense second person narration for Survivor interludes
* The north part of the continent of Tanton is occupied by slightly more high tech nation of dark skinned people. They are officially at war, and have been for longer than Jackann's life, but there's no active hostilities. Only soldiers at the border etc. Several islands off the contient are contested; if any violence happens, it's here.
* There are more islands up north somewhere with a less advanced race of white people. We only hear stories about them.
* Tug gets caught by pirates. She's in a hold, with a cute little black girl called Liali who speaks a musica language. A man from a similar region to Tug's, Tunn, who travels a lot can translate. (He can see. Tug's people are particularly weird.)
* There's a shipwreck. Tug gets washed ashore a series of tall spiky gray mountains which end in a volcano. Liali's body is washed up beside her. Tug is very very badly hurt. She gets picked up by some island locals who carry her through what appears to be impassable spiky rock terrain around and through the spikey mountains. Then there's a road and they put her on a cart. She recovers in their settlement, but they can't communicate. She tries to explain she's looking for Durk but there's really not much to be done. Eventually she shows them something of his.. some pendant or something with a mark.. and they connect the dots to another strange shipwreck victim in another village further along. They take her. Durk and Tug are reunited, yay! Durk has found a love and wants to stay there. Jun is happy there too. Something happens to drive them off again.. maybe the volcano erupts. Tug is restless during her years there, but it's not so bad. She is always homesick.
* Tug's sense is called 'grapping'. The organ is grappnaphene.... (fix this.. google what pigeons have for direction and other things about using magnetic fields to sense). Originally it evolved as a homing device, but also it's useful for telling people's moods and feelings (in lieu of body language) and it does close proximity navigating (like seeing in the dark).
* Nika and Sollh'ara get close. They initially bond over their past abuses and traumas. Jackann spots them kissing when they're washing in a lake. Jackann is jealous and kind of an ass about it.
* When they pick up a sprog, Niki takes care of them.. until they die of bees.
* They also pick up androgynous twins Atta and Dipa.
* Nika is killed by an arrow when they're attacked by a rival (to S'ollhara's) gang of raiders.
* It's unclear whether S'ollhara would have betrayed them if Nika had lived.
* They get to the giant amazing city ruins and S'hollara hands them over to her 'buddies'.
* there's a six year interlude whilst:
** Jackann is imprisoned doing forced labour after S'ollhara sells him out. Sideline: this is how all of Tanton and region's sourcetech is produced, he did not realise.
** Suari finds the under-desert library and starts learning stuff; her long lost brother Tssssomething is there, already having learnt stuff. This is the Survivor 'fine-tuning' it's tooling. Tssss is driven to the Survivor by knowledge. There's a big old block of glowing blue rock in the wall of the library and a tunnel behind it which goes so far until it's too hot to pass. It's come through the center of the planet and stopped there. Tsss wants to find its source; he knows there is great potential to see the universe if he does.
** Tug ends up on a nice tropical island with Durk and a bunch of cool people and everyone is happy. This is the Survivor getting distracted by calibrating Tsss and letting their Durk tool roll down the back of the work bench.
* Then they all move again, eventually convening under the Sourcelands cool desolate futurecity where the Survivor crashed.
* Durk is the only brother who makes it.
* Lark is already incorporated by the Survivor when they get there.
* Tssss dreams to join the Survivor and Suari understands.
* Then with Durk's refusal, Lark and Tsss are like oh well okay we can find a different part okay here's one bye, and the whole giant crashed spaceship just fucking disappears.
* Then they're in a big old hole in the earth and that's not stable any more and rocks start falling and Tug can grapp a tunnel that is stable so she takes them into it. They travel for a long time through the pitch black tunnel through the planet with Tug navigating. It skirts the center of the planet, and eventually intersects with a mine shaft of some kind.
* the end is them emerging under the White Sea

A giant caravan of people, nomadic, travelling through the desert.  They don't know where they're going - they know there is a goal though. they believe that one day someone will awaken and know. Some live in fear of being the chosen one. Some yearn for it. Some don't believe this any longer. Suari probably encounters them.
