# Past

Idea?

QfB is narrated from the second person perspective of a semi-omniscient being in the present tense.

How to decide what you know?  Incomplete knowledge of history of the planet etc.  Is the narrator a significant part of the story or not?  Is the narrator some essence of the planet itself?  I think no, because then it would know too much.

Why is the narrator focusing on these three characters?  Does it matter?  If not, why not?

Some eternal flying being, or essence of the sky or air?  Perspectives from above for describing locations is good.  Air means that a point of view from anywhere is possible.

Can the narrator influence the actions of Suari, Jackann and Tug?  Or poke and prod, or otherwise set actions in motion in some way?  Perhaps using nature.

Narrator is one or all of the 'post-humans' who have ascended.  The ones who haven't are the deities that masquarade in various forms around the world.  The post-humans (need a name) need Durk, Lark and either one of Suari's brothers or (twist) Suari for something.  They were born special.  How many others are there?  The narrator knows Jackann, Tug and Suari will hinder by trying to track down their kin, and have to stop them.  Need to get Lark, Durk and t'other into the Chasm.

I think Durk might join Jackann in Tanton somewhere, before they descend into the Chasm together.

Lark is ascended, I guess, successfully, before Jackann can save him.  Durk knows by this point that someone is after him, and tells Jackann what he knows.  Durk escaped when Lark did not, perhaps.

Lark can come face to face with the narrator, after he has ascended.

Ooh, maybe Suari has a long lost twin who is actually the one.  A brother twin.  Who was lost/sacrificed at birth.  Her quest for a brother is one she doens't even know herself...

Jackann's earthling/wastelander, S'dhor? Sdhor? Sdhora? Sollorha? S'hollora? (She needs at least two names though)

She meets him near athe beginning of his journey, and joins him under some pretext; she's of the west and travelling east for reasosn similar to his - to find a lost family.

But really she's of the Waste, in some way mutated or affected by the Source radiation having been born there. She's returning to her people. Why was she in the west? Stealing something / knowledge from Tanton City?

Suari ends up living/working at a rural/farmhouse like place. Monestary? Refuge of some living gods? Probably in a sudden large oasis after she's on her last leg in the desert having escaped Mntrnao. She resigns herself to that for a while, having matured/continuing to mature and learning about life.

Maybe her contemplation is interrupted by one of her brothers and his followers turning up having been driven out by her other brother.

Maybe Tug joins her there too and they go back to the city rather than meeting in the city. Or maybe she does meet Tug in the city and they are separated and Tug goes into the ravine. I need to think on Tug's journey and goals more.

Tug is searching for her brother who she believes to be in Tanton City. He's after escape from the confines of ice-bound sightless life, and heard of technologies and freedoms of Tanton. So Tug tries to head east then south on her brother's trail, but is taken - kidnapped by pirates? - and sailed west then south to the barely-Tantonian islands. On the voyage, sightless, clueless and imprisoned she sustains a connection with nature/earth/world, inkeeping with the beliefs of her people.

Perhaps Suari's gods are manifestations of this same aspect.

Whatever happens to Jackann's fathers party, Lark is taken by the world/nature. Things are strange under the influence of the Source..

Maybe we see what happens to Lark through Tug's 'eyes'.

Lark becomes distributed, incorporeal. He can see - including his brother's search for him - through trees and clouds and rocks etc. But can't communicate. He and Tug can connect through this.

When Jackann figures out how to extract Lark, the results are disasterous. A monstrous, mutated, unrecognisable creature with Lark inside.

Their father is a.. geographical philosopher? Scholar of theography? His research indicates a sentience of nature and the world, inline with Tug's peoples' beliefs. He thinks the Source problems creeping ever closer to Tanton City can be neutralised if this is better understood, and whatever the religioius attitudes of Tantonians are (undecided; one god? diverse communities? atheism? nothing? indifference? worship of technology?) change. He didn't think to go north to find a culture already in harmony with his findings, which Jackann realises after encountering Tug.

Maybe ditch the second person narrator. Maybe keep writing for now to fill in context gaps and work out later.. kinda derp.

Post-humans stuff is also stupid.

Ages ago I decided S'hollora should have a parasitic twin, and is grossly deformed underneath her baggy clothes. Can't find where I wrote that down.
