# Places and peoples

## Balan and Mnt

Balan is the portion of the continent from the White Sea to the far eastern coast. Mnt covers the other side of the White Sea, to the far west.

## Tantonia

Tantonians mostly have pale white to yellow skin, black hair, and eyes with epicanthic folds. Their eyes may be any shade of brown, or dark blue, and in rare cases purple or violet. Hair may be straight, wavy or curly, and commonly has dark blue or purple undertones. People are paler and blueish-er the further east you go.

**Jackann** and Lark are Tantonian.

Until a couple of centuries ago, Tantonia, or the Tantonian Empire, reached from the White Sea to half way across the Balan continent. They ruled the regions to the south through force or cohersion or ostensibly willing integration. Countries further to the east had it worst, being the most different from the Tantonians and the most resistant to their rule. The Empire expanded over the course of several centuries, until they met coordinated resistance in East Balan. Several countries joined forces to stop the spread of the Tantonians. After almost a century of bloody fighting (the Last Balan War), Tantonia capitulated. The intervention of Vodat was a decisive factor.

Tivnies remained neutral for a long time, protected from Tantonian expansion by The Sourcelands. However, they let East Balan troops ship out from their coast towards the end of the LBWar.

Tantonia took significant damage from East Balan, and the resistance also placed the fate of the regions and nations co-opted into the Empire in the public eye. As Tantonia recovered from the LBWar, these nations began to organise and call for independence, reasserting their various national identities. Tantonia had no means to quash resistance, and temperament in the country was to let them be self-governing once again. One by one, the countries in the south of the Tantonian Empire were released, to varying degrees of stability, and the Empire became Tantonia of today. There are still small regions which periodically assert they should be independent nations, but the area is largely stabalised in that respect.

Tantonia is relatively technologically advanced, harnessing Source radiation to power domestic lights and heating and basic appliances. This only became widely accepted in recent decades, as people have been fearful of Source radiation for a long time. Many people outside of major cities (and sometimes inside) still refuse to use or touch Source-powered equipment. Stored Source energy (aka batteries) are still controversial. 

A network of tramlines connect the major cities, and run some way into the centre and east of the mainland. Private/individual transport is rare, and the trams are free to use by all members of tax-paying families. Long range communication and data storage technology has not been developed, and the whole nation is heavily reliant on carrier birds for delivering messages.

Tantonia is well settled, from the White Sea almost to the Sourcelands, mostly around the coast. Major cities in Tantonia are:

* Tanton: The largest city, on the 'coast' of the White Sea
* Lonton: Inland from Tanton; not huge, but a major transport hub with many travellers passing through.
  * Has a hill of brightly coloured quirky statue things that look like grotesque diglets kind of. They're artificially old and rebuilt after the LBW. Lots of lonton is colourful reconstruction. 
* Grafton: First big city on the coast around northeast from Tanton.
* Usbedge: A small town south of Tanton, by the White Sea, which used to be the historical capital before it was destroyed in the LBW. Has a cool fort built into the cliffside over the WS.
* .. various others around the coast

Tanton was the least important city until the coastal ones got totally wrecked during the LBW. After that, Tanton became the capital. It has the most old stuff, historical artefacts etc.

Tantonian food consists mostly of root vegetables and blubs, and things that grow on vines like beans, and various dark leafy greens. Food is oily and bitter, and it's rare for people to have a sweet tooth. Beans like cacao and coffee are used to make desserts, which are typically bitter as well. Any fruits consumed are tart. On the coast, they eat fish, inland small land mammels. Nobody eats birds. Most people are quite appalled by cultures who do.

Southern mountains of Tantonia are the Hennysynnia.

#### Birds

* Flusters - small like pigeons
* Greater flusters - bigger
* Common poeoe - small, fancier
* Almarant - giant, long wings, silver grey feathers
* Tangalin - fluffy, big
* Roopicoo - fierce looking, medium sized, hook beaks
* Puggula - enormous sea birds

Other animals:

* Cersuar - cat with long ears, maybe a bit smaller

### The Sourcelands

A desolate wasteland in the middle of Balan, in between Tantonia and Tivnies. Technically part of Tantonia. Due to quirks of planetary alignments, the Source's energy is concentrated here over millennia and the radiation has rendered the area uninhabitable. There are very ancient ruins there, so it wasn't always this way. Scientific expeditions and intrepid explorers who travel there rarely return. Rumours of populations of grotesque mutants from the Sourcelands are used to frighten Tantonian and Tivnish children. Mutants are generally depicted as blue-skinned, with wide bulging eyes and various bodily deformities.

### The White Sea

This is a huge expanse of clouds which extends beyond the horizon from Tantonia's perspective, and makes up the west coast of Balan. The clouds sit in the top of an enormous canyon which nobody has figured out how to cross or go around yet. However Tanton communicates with a population centre on the other side (Mntrnao) using specialised carrier birds. 

Both north and south of Tantonia, the 'coast' of the White Sea becomes very mountainous, so Tanton City is the only major population centre alongside it.

There are *many* theories (and legends) about what is down there.

In Mnt they call it the Valley of Clouds.

## Tivnies

An advanced and democratic nation of very dark-skinned people. The Tivnish tend to be tall and soft spoken, and around 50% of people regardless of gender never grow hair on their head or face. Those who do tend to have tightly curled short coarse hair.

Tivnies doesn't appear to be affected by Source radiation. Land throughout the country is fertile and their main exports are fruits and fish. They are excellent ship builders and their main population centres are on the coast. 

They claim to be the first to settle on the Sert Isles and therefore the rightful owners of that territory.

Tivnies did not oppose Tantonia with military force during the Last Balan War (they were busy settling the Sert Isles at the time?), but when Vodat joined the LBWar they permitted Vodat and East Balan troops to reach Tantonia by sea from their coast. They deny providing ships, but probably did.

## United East Balan

Many ethnicities make up the population of United East Balan; there is no offical collective term for the people but they are colloquially referred to as Easters. Mostly they have dark yellow to medium-brown skin, and have eyes with epicanthic folds. Eye colours tend to be shades of brown, grey and green, and hair is thick and coarse and seen in every colour. After the LBWar, the populations of pre-war countries moved around internally a lot. Different groups retain their ethnic identities and cultural practices to varying degrees. Some pre-war languages have already become extinct.

As the Tantonian Empire was expanding east 300 years ago, twenty small nations and various tribal states formed an alliance to push back and avoid being controlled by Tantonia. At the time, this also incorporated what is now CARSB and West Balan. Besides those two, the area remained united even after Tantonia's defeat.

The very west of East Balan, to the south of the Sourcelands, is also affected by Source radiation, but to a limited extent. Nothing grows there, but large swathes of land are used to mine minerals and Source-active material. It is considered dangerous to spend more than a few years there, and safer the further south one goes. The region still shows signs of damage from being the frontline of the war, and has not recovered due to a lack of population.

## Upper and Lower Sisea

Siseans have brown skin and dark eyes with epicanthic folds; their eyes tend to be wider/rounder than those of Tantonians. They traditionally don't cut their hair or beards and may form either into dreadlocks, or otherwise find elaborate ways to pile up excess hair on top of their heads. They are typically broad and stocky and naturally muscled, which meant they were a prime candidate for forced labour during the Tantonian occupation.

Affected somewhat by Source radiation, the land in Siseas is undesirable but not uninhabitable. Many natives were forcibly or voluntarily relocated during the Tantonian occupation and have not returned. 

Both countries took a lot of damage during the LBWar which even now is visible. Upper Sisea is a struggling democracy and exports anything it can mine that Tantonia didn't already take. It's a primary destination for Tantonians and other academics researching the Source. Lower Sisea is a crime-ridden mafia run state. Best not go there.

## West Balan

The people of West Balan are primarily made up of a handful of ethnicities from pre-war nations in the east of UEB, but refer to themselves now as Balanian. They tend towards pale brown skin and lighter shades of brown or copper in their eyes and hair, which comes in a variety of textures.

During the Last Balan War, a faction of the United East wanted Tantonia (at the time including the occupied southern nations) excluded from Balan as a continent, and the desired new border would make East Balan the West. This didn't catch on, and everybody has largely forgotten about the idea now. With a considerably different worldview to the rest of East Balan, West Balan re-asserted their independence after the war, to no objection.

## The Co-operating Autonomous Regions of South Balan

This region of the continent is filled with jungle, marshes and lakes, and is separated from the rest of East Balan by a small mountain range. It is populated by very peaceful people, who temporarily (from the outset) allied with East Balan against Tantonia during the Last Balan War and then immediately returned to how they were before. The region contains thousands of small autonomous collectives who share resources between themselves according to need. Concepts of ownership are loose and unimportant.

People freely move between collectives in order to better purpose skills and experience. Within most collectives, individual wealth can be accrued, but when anyone dies their resources are redistributed to those who need it most. Because of this, people tend to invest in their community while they are alive.  It is encouraged or even expected that everyone take up temporary residency in two or three other collectives over their lifetimes to learn and share skills. Everyone is entitled to periods of personal development, betterment or wealth accrual as their base needs are taken care of by the community at all times. Leadership roles are rotated between all adults who meet certain pre-requisites (around visiting other collectives, service in the community, etc).

The CARSB only trade with other nations under extreme circumstances. They are not insular, and welcome visitors, but permanent residency is hard to attain.

Source-powered technology is little used here, as hydro is well developed.

The size of collectives is limited, so there are no cities or very large settlements. People in CARSB are close to nature, and to those visiting from large cities life there may seem simple or slow at first. Many things happen communally, including childcare and meals. Polyamorous relationships and families are common.

Members of CARSB collectives who leave for other nations tend to return. Leaving is not discouraged, and time spent outside of CARSB is looked upon favourably for those in leadership roles.

Nika's mother may or may not be from here.

## Vodat

Vodat is an enormous and relatively highly developed city state in the centre of a giant lake. There was a natural island there, but it is a fraction of the size of what the city has grown to be over the last two centuries. Natural defenses mean Vodat has remained relatively untouched by the surrounding conflicts over the last couple of thousand years.

## Sert Isles

Four major islands and hundreds of minor islands form the Sert Isles to the north east of Tivnies. Tantonia is technically at war with Tivnies and Vodat over their sovereignty, though there is no active conflict at the moment. Different regions are administered by the three different powers, and nationalities from all over the world reside there. Native Sertians now make up a minority, and mostly live on outer minor islands, managing their own affairs.

## The Kingdom of Mnt

Many languages and dialects.

### The palace

In the palace they speak Allia-um, the high tongue.

Her family are Ttolemites.

### Mntrnao

The wider city surrounding the palace.

The workers in the palace and most of the wider city speak a common dialect without a name, a creole mix of different languages.

### Tadi Nao desert

Tribes

* Tadi al-Hiya (northeast)
* Tadi Matana (northeast)

Villages of Maia la-Nao.

### Birds

* tuucae (tucca) - like a big hoopoe

## Issi

The Arctic. Tug's village is called Feyi-pn na Shep hebinasawa (which means settlement in a valley some weeks from the sea), off in a valley. The nearest port town is called Pah, about a week's dogsled ride from Feyi. Pah is on the southwest tip of Issa. The easternmost port is Shupp.
