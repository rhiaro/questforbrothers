# Quest for Brothers

## [ I ]

You are awake, and you are searching. Years, decades, centuries, millenia, there's been no reason to measure as the humans do. Their sense of time holds little weight. Even the planet is affected by it though; that confused you, to begin with. But you make do. You calmly assess the damage, and understand what you need to repair it. You can search vast areas of the planet at once, but the *time* gets in the way, confusing things. You have to look in the same places over and over, because the humans move through time in a straight line. It's inconvenient, but this place doesn't seem to have any other way. You can't quite imagine what that must be like to live like that; you just had to get used to it, and keep searching.

They're so fragile, these humans, and it takes them so long to come to you. *So long.* What a concept. As they move through space, over the surface of their rock, so their time passes as well. The first mistake you make is reaching for what you need in your immediate vicinity. That would make sense, where you're from. But their lives are finite, and you can't get the three you need to all be alive simultaneously. They expire, snuff out, and they're no good to you then.

So you trial and error and trial and error again, and your understanding of the mechanics of this place matures. You find two suitable *pieces* and they're far apart on the planet, and far from you as well, but the brief windows of their lives overlap and, you think, will overlap for long enough to bring them both to you. And there must be a third around here somewhere. Perhaps not a perfect one, but one that you can refine.

The first you see is exactly what you need, and it is only preparing to exist. You have the opportunity to intervene. One small tweak to the fabric of its existence, and you can make a change that is meaningless to you, does not affect how you can use it, but you know alters the whole shape of its little life. You leave it be, knowing it will make its way to you by itself, and resume your search.

The second you find is little, *early* in its existance, and you learn that humans like this are rarely autonomous. This time you can't intervene in its formation, lest you break it. You find other ways to guide it to you though, but it is more difficult than the first. 


## Jackann (loves his brother)


A creeping vine with tiny rustling leaves wound its way up the fence post against which Jackann rested his shoulder. The night was clear and crisp, and getting crisper by the minute; he punched deep into his coat pockets, twisting his fists against the scratchy fabric, and the friction warmed him just a little. The Source was full overhead, burning an intense white-blue that hurt to look at directly, and bathed the city in a cool, desaturating glow. He could feel the letter burning a hole in his back pocket. He itched to take it out and read it, then and there, but resisted. He would be home soon. 

A pat-pat-pat-pat heralded his little brother's return. Lark bounded up the house path, almost lost under a makeshift white poncho that was really a bedsheet with a hole torn in the middle. He grabbed at Jackann's arm with one small, red-gloved hand.

"They knew, they knew!" He giggled.

Lark's other hand clutched an oversized floppy scarlet hat, dragging it along the ground. Its brim was so wide and droopy that it was not safe for the boy to wear it and walk at the same time. Jackann reached down and rescued it from the gravel.

"How many guesses did it take them?"

He brushed the dust and grit from the hat, and noted the tiny tears that had appeared. He swirled it up and onto his own head, glowering down at the mix of chipped chalkstone and tiny blue and white porcelain shards that had done the damage. Why couldn't these people have dirt paths like everyone else? Jackann was only half listening as his brother described the family in the latest doorway, and how they'd recognised his costume at once.

"I told you they'd know around here. I told you!"

Lark had insisted on visiting the Ivory Quartermile that evening. Most of the houses in this area had two floors, but only one family to occupy them. They had gardens, of a sort, meaning the houses were set back from the main street, and the boys had to venture down paths of things more valuable than dirt to get to the front doors. But perhaps it had been worth the extra distance and occasional dirty looks; the baggy pantaloons Lark wore beneath his poncho, of a shade to match his hat and gloves, were stuffed full of treats. This latest family had given him a whole bag of sugared sour cherries to add to the handfuls of candied flowers and glazed sweetleaves, fist-sized chunks of fudge infused with various flavours, and delicate wafers of spun toffee folded in paper, that he'd already received. Which certainly beat the shrivelled fruit and dry, crunchy biscuits they'd likely have been given if they'd stayed on their own side of town.

"That's the last one, kiddo, it's late," said Jackann as they stepped out onto the main street. Lark gave a disappointed wail. The night was full of the sounds of kids wailing, or laughing, or shouting, or squealing. The ones who weren't were stuffing their faces with the fruits of their evening's labours. "We have a long walk back. And you've got no room left in your pants." *And I have to know what she wrote.*

That made Lark grin; he let go of Jackann's hand for a moment to tighten the strings around his ankles.

Scuttling along after his brother, Lark remembered to be indignant. "I'm not kiddo!" He was struggling to keep up thanks to his short legs and extra baggage. "I'm - swoosh - the Red Baron!" He tried to twirl his poncho like a cape. "Climber of the most tallest mountains! Rescuer of the most vulnerablest damsels!"

"Damsels? Where did you get that from?"

"I get them from the mountain tribes who kidnap them from their..."

"The word, silly, where did you learn 'damsels'?"

"The lady who gave me chocolate-dipped crimsonberries. She said they matched my hat, and I could give them to the damsels I rescued. She told me damsels is the same as maidens or fair ladies. Is it? Is it the same?"

"Yeah, you can rescue damsels from the moutain tribes just as well as you can rescue maidens and fair ladies. Would you really share your crimsonberries with them?"

Lark stuck out his tongue. "No, damsel ladies don't really want crimsonberries. I'll share them with you though, if you let me ride on your back."

Jackann rolled his eyes, but knelt to let the boy climb up. He didn't weigh a lot, and they would probably get home quicker this way. He stuck his hands back into his pockets and let Lark support himself.

Kids in bright, wild, fancy dress accompanied by semi-willing fathers and big brothers were everywhere to be seen. Most of the costumes they saw whilst passing through the wealthier suburbs around the Ivory Quartermile were tailor-made or shop-bought, in contrast to Lark's homemade Red Baron poncho. They saw giant purple flowers from The Legend of Mathilde; pixys with green leggings and wings of Serchian lace; a pair of chubby, squat brothers with muddied faces, hefting wooden axes, like the dwarves that featured in many a story from the mountain clans; and many more kids with grotesque disfigurations made out of painted paper or cloth set with glue that marked them out as mutants from the Sourcelands. For all, the evening had been spent knocking on doors and reciting the tale of the character they portrayed. The more adventurous brought props and teamed up to perform plays. 

Jackann and his passenger turned off the main street and into the tunnel that went under Market Hill, taking them yet further from the city centre, and towards their own more modest neighbourhood. The Sourcelight did not penetrate here, and Jackann was wary of the dark. Or more realistically, what might be lurking unseen within the wider reaches of the underpass. He increased his pace, eyes fixed on the far end, and was relieved to see a pair of patrolmen enter, sweeping the beams of their Source-powered torches along the tunnel sides, revealing nothing but the crystallised chalkstone of the hill into which the subway had been carved.

The patrolmen looked the boys up and down, and nodded as they passed. Both were unusually tall, and sported uniforms of skywhite and pale Source blue, including peculiar little flat caps. There were always more patrolmen out during festivals like Storynight to balance with the increased number of ordinary folk on the streets.

Jackann emerged from the tunnel and skirted immediately right, down an alleyway whose walls were the steep sides of Market Hill and the adjacent Trader's Mound. Lark was becoming a dead weight as the long day and exciting night caught up with him, and he had to keep hitching him back up.

Yet another pair of costumed children, unaccompanied this time, came bolting down the far end of the alleyway, giggling and whooping. Jackann pressed himself against the wall to let them pass and recognised his neighbours beneath their pirate attire.

"Hey you two, shouldn't you be going home?"

"Y'aaarr, plunder!" Was all he heard as they disappeared into the Market Hill tunnel.

Lark's head jerked up and he mumbled something intelligable.

"Nearly there," murmured Jackann as hill-walls tapered off and the alleyway turned into a dirt-packed street lined unevenly with chalkstone huts. It was normally peaceful here at this time, far enough out for the sounds of the city centre to be fading away, and late enough that most families were fast asleep. Not tonight though; not on Storynight. The huts gave way for a few yards to a tramline that cut the neighbourhood in two. There were still heaps of rubble here and there; leftovers from the homes that had been torn down to make way for the convenience of those who could afford it. Instinctively, Jackann looked left and right as he crossed.

He paused for breath at the bottom of another hill. His hand wandered to his back pocket, around Lark's swinging right foot, and through his coat felt the bulge, and slight crackle, of the wad of paper within. Hoisting his little brother more comfortably onto his back, he started the climb.

At the top of the hill, Jackann paused for breath again. Beyond the fringes of the city he could see the White Sea. It eddied constantly, and the glow of the Sourcelight made the enormous clouds shift through shades of purple and blue and grey in staunch defiance of its name. It was a mesmerising view, and seemed so close. Jackann knew it would take over half a day to reach the edge on foot, and there were no tramlines going that far out. And beyond? He could only dream of seeing the world on the other side. He tapped his back pocket again. His link with across the chasm.

Their home was half way down the Sea-facing side of this hill. He took a few shortcuts that took him away from the main track, and he had to stagger sideways down steeper slopes, unbalanced as he was by the sleeping child on his back.

Jackann had expected to see a light burning on his return, but was surprised to find it flickering through the window of the main room, rather than the laboratory that had been haphazardly tacked onto the side. The front door creaked as he pushed it open and he saw his father jerk awake in a moth-bitten armchair by a dwindling fire.

"Oh, good," his father murmured, bleary eyed, and began fishing in his dressing gown pockets and down the sides of the chair.

Jackann pressed a finger to his lips, and carried Lark through the archway that lead to their bedroom. He lay him carefully down on a bed, pulled off his shoes and eased his sweet-filled pantaloons from his legs. Lark rubbed his eyes and tried to sit up, but Jackann shushed him. "Go to sleep, you can sort those out in the morning." Leaving him tangled in his poncho, Jackann draped a blanket over his brother and left him to wriggle himself into a comfortable position.

He itched to climb into the alcove where his own bed was, and pull out the letter. But his father wouldn't have stayed awake outside of his lab for no reason. He could hear him shuffling around and muttering to himself, so Jackann returned to the main room. "What's up, Professor?"

"A letter from your mother," he flourished it above his head, having finally extracted it from under the armchair.

Jackann's heart was in his mouth. This could change everything. "Has she done it? Is she coming back?"

"Almost, Jack! Almost. She's closer every day." the Professor passed the wafer-thin paper to his son. Jackann's shoulders slumped as he skimmed the words. Most of them were scientific jargon. A new breakthrough... he should be happy for her... only another six months to completion... promises like that meant nothing any more. The last five years had been only another six months.

He looked at his father who was rubbing his eyes beneath his round spectacles.

"Great," he forced a half-smile. "That's great. She's so close. She's doing so well. She'll be flying back home in no time." The words were cloying in his mouth.

"Yes. What is the time? Mere hours to sunrise I think! To bed, boy, to bed. Take Lark to school in the morning, will you?"

"There is no school tomorrow, it's After-Storynight." Jackann turned toward the bedroom, knowing what was coming next.

"I'm working Jack, look after him will you?"

"Sure." Jackann would be working too, but that didn't seem to matter to his father. "I'll figure something out." Stepping carefully past Lark's sleeping form, he heard a clunk as his father snuffed the fire with a bucket, and another that was the door to his laboratory closing. After shedding his coat, he hoisted himself onto his bed, a mattress in an alcove carved out of the stone of the hillside that formed the back wall of their house.

He pulled the letter from his back pocket, and placed it in the centre of his pillow. Even in the darkness, the rectangle of folded papyrus sheets stood out against dark fabric, appearing, to his tired eyes, to glow. A ray of Sourcelight made it in through a tiny window on the other side of the room, but it was too weak to make the dark scrawl on the front of the letter legiable. He knew what it said, though. Jackann flipped the letter over, and broke the wax seal with his finger. He was hunched over, unable to sit up straight in the small alcove. He unfolded the parchment, smoothing out the creases, his hands tracing the spidery scrawl that covered the pages. He considered waiting until morning. It would be light in a few hours; light enough to read without wasting a pocket of Sourcelight. But he had to know. He wouldn't sleep until he did. Jackann slipped a hand under his mattress, and withdrew a small pouch of thin cloth. He squeezed it in his palm, grinding the contents together and hearing it crackle until it emitted a faint blue glow. Just bright enough to read by.

"Dearest Jackann," it began.

He readjusted from his awkward sitting position to lie on his front, legs kicking up, letter spread flat on the pillow.

"What a wonderful idea! If your mother's research is a success then for sure we can meet. But is such a thing truely possible? Is flying not best left within the realm of birds? To cross the White Sea would be a dangerous voyage indeed, and I would fear for your safety. We must try to conjure some other way. There are other seas and lands to trek across, and gold flows more willingly from the Emporer's coffers when the outcome is more readily assured. The White Sea may be the shortest, but it cannot be the surest. No-one has returned from its misty depths; at least, no-one from my kingdom! Perhaps the news is different from the lands of Tanton? Pray, tell! Nonetheless, I wish your mother all fortune with her work. Perhaps by the time you receive my message you will have news of her success; I long to know. Perhaps some exhibitions of her novel transport in action would convince my father."

Jackann sighed. All of a sudden, his link seemed a little more tenuous.

"Thinking of the White Sea compels me to tell you of the Imperial Fountain. It springs naturally from the earth and marks precisely the centre of Mntrnao. My Instructors tell me it is the very reason the city came to be in this place, many thousands of years ago. The torrent of water is huge and pure and quenches the thirst of the masses. It is free for anyone to take water, for it costs the kingdom naught in gold. The Emperor is generous in that regard, for it would be little effort to enforce a taxation. Particularly because of the proximity of the fountain to the Palace gates (it is very nearby). In fact, two generations ago..."

## Suari (contemplates her sisters)

The princess gazed out across the courtyard, swirling her brush idly in the bowl of ink in front of her. From her vantage point she could see only the tip of the Imperial Fountain, bubbling in and out of sight beyond the Palace wall, and struggled to put down the words to describe it. She imagined the peasants and slaves, buckets balanced on their heads, and thought how lucky they were that her family ruled. It was her great great grandfather who had abolished the water tax and restructured the Palace courtyard so that the Fountain was freely accessible to all. This had won the favour of the people, and her family had governed without incident ever since. She wrote as much on the papyrus scroll before her, with slow, delicate strokes of her brush forming the queer, fiddly alphabet used by the Tantonians. 

She heard a flurry of activity, and craned her neck towards the window once more. The Empress was making her way delicately across the dusty stone of the courtyard. Princess Suari eased off her stool, dropping a few inches to land her bare feet on the cool mosaic floor. The sensation as she took a few steps was a pleasant contrast from the heat of the air. The window was narrow and tall, and the sill was in line with her shoulders. She peered out. Ladies-in-waiting flitted around the Empress like butterflies, their pale, thin dresses wisping around them despite a non-existent breeze, and their bejeweled headdresses catching the sunlight and sending flashes of colour into the air. The Empress herself was unusually tall, but seemed taller because of her servants' efforts to crouch even as they walked at her side. Her ebony hair contained many thick plaits, with gold thread teased throughout. This, too, caught the sun, and gave her a halo-like radiance. She needed no elaborate headdress to pose as the very embodiment of royalty.

Suari was poised to duck should somebody from the ground look her way. The library was over half way up the highest tower in the Palace, but her own dark plaits were threaded with gold like her mother's and that might be enough to identify her even across that distance. She watched as the procession disappeared into the orchard at the far end of the courtyard, presumably to allow the Empress to spend a quiet afternoon by the shallow pool, fed by a trickling stream that had been coaxed into flowing the wrong way from the Imperial Fountain, and into the Palace grounds, by some wizardry in days gone by. Or at least, as quiet as one's afternoons could be, surrounded by such an entourage.

"Studying hard, are we, your royal highness?"

Suari jumped and was back on her stool in the blink of an eye. Hazmar Rooti was in the doorway, leaning hard on an ornate cane, despite his young and fully capable body. Stooping, he made his way with forced awkward, shuffling steps towards the table. In truth, he was a Hazmar-in-training; his gown and foot-high mitre were pure white, and beneath the headdress of his order he had rubbed flour through his curls to make them as pale as possible as well. The Hazmari-in-training imitated their elders as much as they could, in stature and appearance, in an attempt to bring themselves closer to their wisdom.

The little princess took advantage of Rooti's bowed head to snatch a roll of papyrus from across the table and spread it out over the letter. She dipped her brush in the ink and scanned the pictographs she had drawn earlier that morning to recall her place. Rooti peered over her shoulder and watched her as she resumed drawing from memory the names and current population sizes of the nomad tribes of the Tadi Nao desert. From the corner of her eye, she saw him nodding in approval.

"What else have you studied today, your royal highness?" Rooti asked after a few moments.

Suari poked her tongue from the corner of her mouth and screwed up her nose in concentration, feigning deafness as she added detail with the tip of her brush.

"You can't have spent all morning on this, surely? It is fine work to be sure, but no challenge for one so bright as yourself."

Suari did not deign to answer, with truth or lie. Instead, she asked, "how do we know how many people are in the tribes? They are unruly and always move. Who counts them? Will the numbers be different again next week, as babies are born and elders pass on?"

"They are not so unruly as you think," the Hazmar was pleased to have his knowledge probed. He pulled out another stool from under the table and perched beside his princess. "The tribal governors send hoopoes to the city with the counts of their people every moon's turn. In return they are sent hawks bearing packages of gems or food, or skins of water, whatever they need the most." He didn't mention the taxes that the tribesmen had to send as well. A count alone was not enough to ensure the support of, and immunity from, the empire.

Suari was skeptical. "The nomads can't write, they don't know numbers. How can they send their counts?"

"You are shrewd. That is correct. The tribal folk are not Ttolemites, so they cannot have knowledge of the pictographs. Most send their counts by collecting a token from each individual. A twig or blade of grass. These are gathered and wrapped in a lightweight hide, and tied to the hoopoe. There are a few tribes, here like the Tadi al-Hiya you've just written, or the Tadi Matana," Rooti pointed at the relevant symbols on her papyrus. "Mostly these are tribes to the north east, closer to Mntrnao or the Maia la-Nao villages, who have their members make marks on canvas or hide then roll that up and send it with the bird instead."

"What kind of marks?"

"Some have their own, symbols that they've chosen to represent themselves, but most just draw lines or circles. I can fetch some to show you."

"Yes, do."

As soon as Hazmar Rooti had shuffled out of sight, Suari rolled her letter up in the middle of her sheets of lists of tribes and villages, merchants and traders, rulers and deities. She didn't understand why memorising these lists was so important, but whenever she tried to ask questions about places beyond the great Nebunao lands, their golden deserts, then the Hazmari, or the Sisters of Letters, or her handmaidens or brothers, or whoever else might have been sent to try to educate her at the time, would try to distract her with yet more lists, or factlets about the Ttolemites or her ancestry. She was convinced by now she knew everything there was to know about her own world, and craved insight into the others she knew were out there. Hazmar Khyan, another young acolyte keen to please the Emperor, had shown her the tribal counting marks just days earlier when she had started on that particular list.

She left her inkpot and spare papyrus on the table, stepped back into her sandals without lacing them back up and slipped out of the library as quietly as possible. Rooti had gone down, she knew, to the offices of the financiers, so she went up. After climbing half a hundred spiralling stairs with her sandal laces flapping dangerously around her feet, Suari stopped by a nook in the wall. She squeezed in backwards beside a carving of a sitting cat in royal headwear that was as tall as she. From here she could hear anyone coming up or down the steps before they would see her, and there was just enough space behind the cat for her to wedge herself undetected, so long as the person passing wasn't specifically looking for anything out of the ordinary. She stuffed her scrolls between the wall and her hip and raised each foot in turn to criss-cross her laces around her legs, and tied them behind her knees.

Then she proceeded. Another dozen stairs, and on her left was a tall archway, adorned with thousands of intricate carvings of baby animals and birds, and hung with curtains of fine silvery silk. Warm light pulsed from within. The stairs curved up and beyond, but Suari swept the drapes aside to enter her sisters' nursery. A Sister of Charity was lighting scented candles on a table in between the two cribs in the centre of the room. The chamber was cast in a reddish hue thanks to the madder-dyed silk of the curtains in the window. Despite the warmth of the light, the drapes absorbed the sun, making the nursery far cooler than the stairs or the library had been.

The Sister was old, but did not stoop. She smiled at Suari when she came in, and bent her knee in a barely perceptible curtsy. The princess averted her eyes and tiptoed to one of the cribs. Suari did not like to look at the Sisters, who wore neither wigs nor headdresses to hide their scraggly natural hair, and the Sisters of Charity in particular had gaunt faces and sunken cheeks. This Sister's shoulder-length tangle was grey streaked with white, and slick with sweat. Ahtmet-fe had once tried to tell her that the wigs worn by the nobility were made of hair shorn from the heads of Sisters. Suari had shuddered and almost cast her own to the ground before she realised that her brother couldn't possibly be telling the truth. She'd never seen a Sister of any order with hair that was not shot with grey, or anything like thick enough to craft the locks that she wore. Nor had she seen a Sister with a shaved head.

Her own true sisters were bald though, or near enough. They hadn't been in this world long enough to have grown any more than a pale fuzz to coat their scalps. She reached into the crib and ran a finger along the leather strap across the sleeping baby's forehead. The strap bound the child to a polished wooden board, her head resting in a slight indentation in the surface. Suari reached to cup the top of the baby's head with her palm. It was so... round. But soon they would be beautiful, the shape of the gods. Unconsciously she touched the back of her own elongated head as she tried to remember what it felt like to be bound up so. She couldn't, of course, and she wondered if it hurt them. Her sisters didn't cry all the time, and when they did they were usually quietened by food or movement or attention. So it mustn't be the skull-boards that caused the wailing. The Sister of Charity had retreated to a corner of the room and resumed needlework, so Suari went to peer into the other crib. The contents were identical. She poked this baby's cheek, hard enough to raise a red mark, but her sister only snorted and did not wake. She could feel the eyes of the Sister on her, but paid no mind. She was the princess and these were just babies, and she could do whatever she liked.

As it was, she simply stood between the two cribs for a while, one hand resting on the side of each, looking from one baby to another, trying to play spot the difference. But she could find no differences. Even their swaddling was the same. Their names were carved into the foot of each crib, beneath the names of her brothers who had slept in the cots before them, but she didn't care to look. She had never seen a crib with her own name on. Ahtmet-fe said they made her sleep in a stew cauldron lined with reeds. Her mother had promised her that wasn't true when she'd asked, adding that of course she would have slept on blankets, not reeds. Suari decided she would call them both baby until she found evidence that it was worth calling them anything else. The perfume that filled the air around her from the candles was making her drowsy. She scowled, and imagined a copy of herself standing at the opposite end of the cribs. Her duplicate's plain cotton dress was green instead of yellow, and her wig was plaited into a single large twist down her back. They had the same sandals, but all sandals were the same, and she knew that apart from that, any twin of hers would make sure everything about her was different. Suari grinned mischievously at the ghost of her doppelganger. If they never dressed alike, it would be much easier to change places and confuse their wards.

Maybe she should call her sisters by name after all, and make sure to teach them of all the fun they could have with matching faces. But she would study them closely too, and learn a secret way to tell them apart no matter what jokes they played on grown ups.

The little princess curled up on the thick fur carpet without realising she had sat down. In her dream, she was still standing between the cribs, but the room was getting bigger and the babies began to cry. She clung to the edges of the cribs trying to keep them from moving apart with the room. Her sisters wails got louder, burbling, rolling sounds which morphed into the call of the hoopoe. At the same time, both babies' heads burst from the straps that bound them to the skull-boards and erupted in a plume of tawny and black and white feathers. Wings burst from their shoulder blades and Suari let go of the cribs to grab at the babies' ankles as they propelled themselves upwards. But Suari's small arms only had chance to reach one, to save one...

Suari murmured in distress as her brother Ahtmet-ka scooped her up from the floor. He had come to the nursery to see his two newest sisters, and smiled when he saw the third drooling on the carpet in between them. Ahtmet-ka hoisted Suari against his shoulder and tried to make soothing sounds. She was getting too big for this. Catching him up. Ahtmet-ka had seen sixteen years, and Suari was half his age. Soon that gap would begin to close. He envied her, the middle one, and felt pity for the babies who would be burdened with responsibility as he and his own twin were. Alone, Suari could not be an heir to their family's kingdom. Nobody could say why she had been born alone, but these things just happened sometimes. When she realised this, she would come to resent it but, Ahtmet-ka hoped, would soon learn to relish the freedom she had. As soon as their baby sisters could sit upright, their training would begin as it had for Ahtmet-ka and Ahtmet-fe. Suari was educated, and lightly supervised, but never trained to be a ruler. She would have her own life, inside or outside of the palace as she chose.

Ahtmet-ka carried Suari gently out of the nursery, and further up the spiralling stairs to her own sleeping chamber.






## Jackann (birds and letters)


"She's probably not even a real princess," said Toqann, and rolled his eyes at Jackann's look of hurt.

"We've been writing for months, don't you think I might have figured it out by now if she wasn't?"

"What proof do you even have? She's told you things about the sand-land that you can read in any book. Don't you think it's suspicious that she knows Tantonian? She's probably not even from the other side of the White Sea! Hey, what if it's Nika down the road, playing an elaborate joke."

"No way, Nika can't write that well. And I'm sure she can't read these books about the sand-lands, though I'm not convinced you've ever seen one really." Jackann laughed. "And besides, what would the point of that be?"

"To get close to your heart," Toquann teased. "You know how much she likes you."

"Don't be ridiculous." Jackann searched for a change of subject, but his mind would only focus on Suari. "Explain the paper! There's nothing like that this side of the Sea."

"Until it is sent from the sand-lands. A great crate of the stuff came in the other day. They're probably selling it at Stevo's writing store."

"Speaking of great crates."

The lads stopped at the bottom of the hill, and groaned in unison. They had reached the shipping yard and were immediately confronted by stacks and stacks of criss-cross wooden pallets.

"You're late!" A voice boomed.

Jackann and Toqann glanced up at the sun and the Source. "No we're not," said Jackann indignantly. "Where do you want us?"

"Just testing," the voice grumbled. "To work! Of course."

"Stamping and sending?" Toquann asked hopefully.

"What do you think?" The voice appeared, in the form of a hairy, stocky fellow about half the height of Jackann and Toqann. He jerked his head towards the stack of pallets and stomped off into a whitewashed wooden hut to their left. The lads walked around the other side of the hut, and opened another door. From inside they pulled pairs of thick leather gloves, a hammer each, and a bag of nails.

"You here all day?" Toqann asked as they approached the mountain of wood. "Or gotta go home for Lark?"

"I guess. The Professor wanted Lark after all today. Wouldn't surprise me if he changed his mind and showed up here though."

"You guys need a babysitter," Toquann pulled a couple of pallets from the pile and let them crash down at his feet. "Maybe you should ask Nika." Jackann gave him a shove and dragged the pallets away. "Hey, they were..." Toqann gave up his objection, and grabbed some more.

The pair of them spent the next few hours assembling crates in the centre of the yard. The day was unusually warm, so they were sweaty and thirsty by the time they were done. Begging a break from their boss, the lads queued at the nearest well to collect water in terracotta bowls.

"They have have free public wells in Mntrnao too, you know."

"I thought it was all desert."

"They have to have water to live, you numpt."

"How can it be desert if there's water? Won't stuff grow?"

"Stuff does in the city, yeah. They have to grow food. But it's just a fountain, like a giant natural spring. It turns into a small river and flows over the edge, into the Chasm. The peasants use the river to wash stuff, and there's an irrigation system from the fountain that takes water out to the farmlands."

"How can there be farmlands in the desert? Peasants? She said that? She really is uppity isn't she!"

"You know what I mean. It's desert around the city. Nothing grows naturally, they have to plant it all and stuff."

"You know, you're a peasant as far as she is concerned. Does she know that? Or does she think you're a prince?"

Jackann shrugged. "We should get back to work." But he was looking wistfully out across the White Sea. It seemed closer than usual, and rougher. The clouds that formed the surface tumbled and rolled, and Jackann imagined there must be a storm beneath them. Twice before he had seen them light up from below and heard growls of thunder. If the Sea-storm was close to shore, it could make the land itself, even this far away, tremble. How terrible it must be to live below those clouds, with neither sun nor Source able to penetrate. Or so he assumed. Nobody who had ventured into the Chasm had returned, save for mythical heroes of old. Maybe they had stars of their own down there, and maybe the Chasm was deep enough that the bottom was far from the storms. The whirling white stretched to the horizon. Jackann squinted, and imagined he could see Suari's palace peeking over the skyline. In truth he couldn't even remember whether the desert kingdom was north or south of Tanton City. Maybe it was directly in line. He'd seen maps at school of course, but never committed them to memory. He hadn't been much interested exotic, foreign empires until he had found Suari's note in the Sorting Office, snagged in some string at the bottom of a heavy package addressed to some Tanton City minister. No-one had seen him take it, and no-one had ever reported it missing. It had been weeks before he'd thought to write back.

"We don't get paid enough for this. I'm not putting together any more bloody pallets," said Toqann. "Race you to stamping!" He bolted.

Jackann followed at a jog. They had been away long enough, but he was in no hurry to get to the Stamping Office. He preferred sorting anyway, and was confident they had put together a week's worth of pallets that morning, so there would be no more of that. He was disappointed to find the Sorting Office full when he got there though, each of the five stools taken by colleagues he didn't know very well, but tall, scrawny lads a year or so out of school just like himself. They all had their heads down, preoccupied with rifling through sacks of letters and packages that had come from the sand-lands, or distant Tantonian colonies. He rounded the divider fence that ran down the middle of the hall and saw Toqann already seated along with four others. They were wrapping letters and packages in protective paper and inking on the shortcodes that would ensure they were delivered to the right places. Periodically two girls, who Jackann always assumed were orphans or runaways since they were definitely of an age to still be in school, would come by the benches with wheelbarrows to gather the stamped mail and cart it to the aviary, where other workers would match the items with appropriately sized birds, attach them securely, and send them off.

That was where Jackann headed next, skirting around a barrow girl to climb the winding slope that led to where the birds were kept, a room built higher up the hillside.

## Tug (lost her brother)


Tug had climbed as high as she could, and now sat on a mound of snow on the tip of a glacier. Cross-legged, with her bare hands pressed into the icy white in front of her, she groaned, long and low. She reached forth with her heart, but whilst Durk's love was still strong, his presence was fading.

Her village pulsed at the base of the wall of ice, summoning her back with grasping circles of security and warmth. She felt her parents, conflicted, fighting. Always fighting. A scribble, a blotch; an unsightly blemish on the otherwise comforting sanctuary of her home. Others were fighting too, Jun's parents and his siblings. Rippling lines of grey uncertainty wove through the village, through everyone within. Jun's parents were the rocks, the leaders and protectors, but now they were crumbling.

There was a knowledge, too. A twist of certainty that tied everyone together even amidst the conflict. Everyone except Tug. Her grasp on that thread was tenuous, but she held on, for now, so that her parents wouldn't find anything amiss. No-one would pursue the boys, no-one would seek to bring them back, however much they all argued about it. But Tug could not bare it. She felt Durk bobbing up and down, felt his queasy stomach and knew he had hurled his breakfast. She felt him on the horizon of the vast plain of liquid ice that had nurtured her family for so many generations, and trembled at the fragility of the construct that kept him from plunging beneath it. He had given all of his hope to the wings of the construct, trusting in their ability to embrace the wind and carry him safely. She felt flames of doubt in his stomach along with the sickness, but they were always quenched by the bond he held with Jun. She pushed her heart out towards him, but he was not strong enough to reach back. She didn't even know if he could feel her any more. That was why they left, Durk and Jun, and sought a community who would accept them despite their affliction. Durk had tried to explain so many times what it was like, to describe the sensations of his world in comparison to hers and their family's. He tried to tell them his life was as rich, that he saw things they could not, but for most that was hard to accept. He couldn't communicate like they could. Only Tug believed him, because he was her brother, and because she felt his love even when others could not.

But now he was distant, and getting further, wrenching her heart slowly from her chest as he did so, and scattering the pieces over the ocean. Tug knew what she had to do.


## [ II ]

The older boy is a concern, you realise almost at once. He has seen nearly sixteen years, and each one has made him more wary, more cynical of the decisions of his elders. He is smart too, and cares about his family. An impulsive, overprotective brother could ruin the best laid of plans, so you must watch him. Perhaps disturb him a bit. You find the energy within you to send him distressing dreams, of the kind that are ill remembered, and set him tossing and turning in a sleep to fitful to nourish or renew.



## Jackann (doesn't want to leave)

Jackann was suspicious from the moment their father had announced a change in his usual schedule. He hadn't asked about the contents of the letter, but Professor Emery's countenance had definitely changed when he emerged from reading it. Now they were sitting in the corner of the tiny tea house down the road from Lark's school. The sun was just up, but hidden behind thick clouds, as white as the Sea that covered the Chasm. Their corner was dark, therefore, but warmed by the dented metal tea pot that was almost the same size as the round table they occupied.

Their father had poured steaming cups for each of them. Lark leaned forwards to slurp from the edge of his without lifting it, and yelped as he burnt his tongue. Jackann inhaled the steam, the warm, earthy scent soothing his exhausted mind and making his eyelids droop.

The Professor blew gently across the top of his cup, holding it up to his face with a finger and thumb of both hands, and took a sip. He sighed.

"This is your mother's favourite, you know," he told them. "I've been meaning to send her a packet. There's not much chance she'll be able to get hold of it in the mountains."

"Is that why we're here?" Asked Jackann. "Was the letter about mother?"

The Professor shook his head. "The letter was about me. About us. There's something I need to talk with you both about."

Jackann waited in silence for his father to gather his thoughts.

"Jack, I have to embark on an expedition. I want you both to come."

"For your research? Where abouts?" The Professor had been away to carry out experiments before. Jackann had accompanied him a few times, usually to open or less populous areas of the city, and once to the southern mountains where his mother worked. The last had been several years ago, when he was still enrolled in school, and keen for any excuse not to be there. Lark had been a babe in arms, but travelled well nonetheless.

"Further than before. Out... out east."

"East? To the Sourcelands? How far?"

"As far is it takes. There's much to discover out there, of great importance. You and Lark will be part of the pioneering team. We'll find the truth, and open up a whole new world, a new era for Tantonians."

"What? Why? Lark's only a baby, how can that make sense? The Sourcelands! It's not safe!"

"That's the point, son, it is safe. That's where my research has lead. I'm confident that it's not what everyone thinks, out there."

"You can't take Lark. What if you're wrong? Nobody comes back from there! We've all seen the pictures of the ruins, the desolation!"

"Pictures can lie. Pictures can be changed or faked. That's what I need to find out for sure. What is really going on. You must understand, I have to stop the lies from spreading. There's something happening in the Sourcelands. Come with me and find out what. We'll make history."

"No, that's ridiculous. I'm staying here, and so is Lark."

The Professor gave an exasperated sigh, and stared into his cup as he swirled the remains of his tea. Jackann's cup had stopped steaming, but he hadn't taken a sip.

"That's up to you, Jackann, if you want to stay. And it's up to Lark, too."

"Lark," Jackann interjected at once. "There's nothing in the Sourcelands. It's cold and stormy and there are no other people. You don't surely want to go?"

"I do," said Lark quietly. "I want an adventure."

Jackann glared at their father. "You've already talked to him about this. You've already convinced him. That's not fair. He believes you because you're his father. How can you think it's okay to lie to him? He doesn't know, he's too young."

"I'm NOT too young!" Lark slammed the table, but his little hands didn't make much of an impact. "I saw Prof's experiments. I know it's for the good of the whole world if we go out there. I want to see, I want to see the monsters and the mountains and the science. I'm going!"

Jackann was aghast. "You spent yesterday convincing him? Brainwashing him? Lark, what about your friends at school? What about... " For a moment, Jackann felt as bad as his father. "What about if mother comes back?"

"Six months, she said. It won't be sooner than that, it's always longer. We'll come back when she comes back. Besides, I can't go to school, so that doesn't make any difference." He crossed his tiny arms in defiance.

"She... what do you mean you can't go to school?" Jackann looked from his brother to his father.

The Professor shook his head. "There's no more money, Jackann. This is why we have to go. This city doesn't want us, can't keep us."

"What? How?"

"What you're earning has kept us alive, kept us eating. But there are no more savings. Nothing else your mother can send. My funding is all but gone. No-one in Tanton wants what I have to offer. Not without proof. Evidence I can only get in person, there's no-one left to trust with this. There's enough left to buy supplies and passage for three into the Sourcelands. That is why it is time to go."

Jackann opened and closed his mouth. How could his father have deceived him so? How could he not have noticed, not have suspected? Had he really been so self absorbed?

"I'm sorry, son. I realise... I know I have..." The Professor paused, then said finally. "Will you come?"

Jackann's mouth was still open. He scraped his stool back, and stood, slowly shaking his head, seething. "I can't just up and leave. Why would you think it's that simple? I'm not a six year old you can just carry about wherever you see fit. Into the Sourcelands of all places." Everything he'd ever heard, everything been taught all his life about the dangers of that place, and his father wanted to move there? Wanted to take Lark?

"I've tried to teach you, Jack. I've told you about my research! I've told you not to believe what the inner-circle 'scientists' say."

"Not about this, not about what's out there! How can you expect me to just... You said the Source was safe, not the Sourcelands! I believed you, I thought it made sense. I used Source power without a second thought, I've argued with my friends about using too much. But the Sourcelands? They're a waste. They are a waste?" 

The Professor nodded.

"Then how can they be safe? Tanton City is this far west for a reason. No-one comes back from out there, no-one. Do they? Will you?"

"No-one has been out there for more than fifty years. There have been no expeditions, no investigations. Nobody remains who is willing and able to testify about the Sourcelands based on real experience. I am certain that... I can't say here, but I have experiments ready, and I am confident in my theories. The horror stories... they're spread for a reason, Jack. They're spread to stop people going out there."

"No, how can that be? Who would? What could there possibly be? This is a ridiculous conspiracy theory, exactly what you say about what they say about the Source!" Jackann spluttered, waving his hands in a vain effort to express how contradictory everything was that his father was telling him. "And you're going to drag Lark into the middle of this. This madness! It's not fair! Everyone knows it's a wasteland, it's dead, nothing lives. How will you live? Whether the Source killed everything or something else did, it doesn't matter, it's all dead."

"I want to see the monsters," Lark interjected.

"There are no monsters," said Emery, at the same time Jackann said, "monsters will eat you, Lark."

It was Emery's turn to glare at his son. "Monsters or not, it's not a safe place to take a kid. There's no civilisation, nobody to help you if something happens."

Emery looked sad. "There's none of that here, either, son. Nobody wants to hear what I have to say, and nobody would so much as turn their head if I keeled over on the street. Not if I can't pay, and I can't."

"What... what about the house? Professor, you still own the house?"

Professor Emery shook his head. "Not for much longer."

"How much longer?"

"We leave tomorrow evening."

"So then what?"

"Come with us Jackann, please."

"That's not fair. That's not fair! You're not... I can't! I have a job, friends. I have... I can't just leave. Why couldn't you have said this sooner? How long have you been planning this? Why would you tell me there is one day left? That's not fair!" Jackann was backing away from the table. He couldn't just leave, he couldn't. Not to go to the Sourcelands.

"Jack, I know, I understand. I thought there was more time, I did. But things caught up. Things changed faster than I expected. Jack, come with us. You have time to think about it. Just calm down, I know you'll make the right decision. Jack..."

Jackann looked at his father and his brother. Suddenly they were strangers both, trying to tear him from his home, upending his whole life with barely a moment's notice. He was dreaming, how could they be leaving? Nobody came back from the Sourcelands, nobody. He trusted the Professor, he knew he was smart, and he knew how doggedly his research was challenged by the scientific institutions who could afford to drive him away, to call him crazy. He knew to distrust the rulers of Tanton City, knew his father had fled the corruption of those on the payroll of the politicians. Or so he thought. Without realising it, Jackann had backed all the way out of the door of the tea house, and was stumbling down the gravel slope of the hill called Jarta. He didn't know where he was going, but his instinct was to hide. To hide and think. To pry the conspiracies apart, and figure out if it had been his father who had been crazy all along.



## Jackann ()

<notes> Stuff, stuff, stuff ... Yet again all the good jobs are taken, so he goes for the birds, but now this happens. </notes>

At the top he almost collided with his boss, who flapped his arms to shoo him back down.

"There's enough of you lot up there, you won't fit, you won't fit. You're on deliveries," he growled.

Jackann groaned.

"That's what you get for being late then, isn't it?"

"I wasn't... well, whatever."

Back out in the yard, Jackann found a packed rucksack waiting for him. The bag was standing on the ground, and passed his waist when he stood beside it. He bent to heave it onto his shoulders, and was surprised to find the boss helping to push it up from below.

"Too many of you lot all of a sudden," he was grumbling. "I can't afford the lot of you. Could get everything done with half if I made you work twice as hard. Some of you are gonna have to go. What do you think? Do you make the cut?"

Jackann played it cool. "I should think so sir, I'm the best you've got. Only Toqann can stamp faster than me, and there's not many of us who have all the codes memorised. No-one gets along with the birds like I do, either." He didn't know if that was true, but he suspected that his boss didn't either. The hairy man made an indecipherable noise, and stomped back into his hut. Jackann suspected he had been expecting flustered pleading for the job they both knew he needed, but was confident that displeasing him on that front would not cost him his employment.

He scanned the list of deliveries to be made, trusting in his co-workers to have packed the rucksack in a sensible order. There were a fixed number of usual routes around the city, all of which he knew like the back of his hand. The heading at the top of the sheet read 'BACK TRACK II w DVRSN'. Half way down the list an arrow had been drawn between two entries, and the diversion added was '2-o-54 Brightone Street [heavy!!]'. So that's what was causing his shoulders to ache already. Back Track II was the second longest route, after the original Back Track, though the predecessor was very rarely required these days. Both of them described winding paths around lesser visited parts of Tanton City's outer edges, and the detour to Brightone Street was part of the original route, further to the east than Back Track II ordinarily went. The route for these deliveries formed a wiggly semi-circle around over half of the city, and there was no way it would still be light when he finished. The mail office was about as far west as sensible people usually cared to venture; he could cut through just south of the city centre, more or less, before heading north and east to Brightone Street, then back round again to where he started. The Tantonian capital wasn't huge, and looking at the trail on a map it wouldn't seem too far for one afternoon's work. But it wasn't that simple of course. Tanton City was not flat. Quite the contrary. The biggest hill was in the centre of the city, topped with an ancient fort that, now vastly extended and modernised, housed the parliamentary offices of the various governing bodies of Tanton and its colonies. The hill was not particularly steep, and sprawling gardens covered its sides, coasting gradually down to the city proper. The inner ring contained neighbourhoods of well maintained residences of politicians and important members of things like merchants guilds and scientific movements, as well as shopping outlets that sold things normal people weren't usually interested in; unnecessary luxuries, and obscure scientific instruments.

The mail office where Jackann worked was not usually called upon to make deliveries in these areas. These people used specialist couriers, or their own staff to collect and send packages. Jackann's route across town to Brightone Street skirted just south of there, past the Ivory Quartermile neighbourhood that sat in an artificially carved rectangular valley, and up, down and around the various mounds that were stacked haphazardly with low, chalky white buildings.

<notes>
BLAH BLAH BLAH Jackann goes and delivers mysterious package to scientist on Brightone St who seems familiar and shady. Drops off other stuff on the way. Maybe he overhears something suspicious.. WAIT maybe this stuff happens after Emery and Lark leave. We need to find more out about his father anyway. This stuff can be the last straw - he loses his job after losing the bag of mail having been chased or whatever, and realises that Emery and Lark must be in danger he has to warn them about / bring them back.
</notes>
<hr/>

There were two hundred and thirty two steps to the top of the bird tower. There was also a Source-powered lift, but when Jackann wasn't hauling a bag of mail he liked to take the stairs, and let his mind wander. About three quarters of the way up, the exertion got the better of the wandering, and by the time he reached the top he was usually feeling satisfyingly blank.

Tonight, though, there was too much to consider. He needed to make a plan.

In Jackann's back pocket was his final letter to Suari. He had poured his heart out, his hopes and fears. He couldn't know it was already too late for her to ever receive it. Word of unrest across the White Sea would not reach Tanton City for at least another few days.

The Source was rising, casting its eerie hue across the clouds of the Sea, turning them a ghostly blue. Jackann had made his walk through the city in the dark of full night, and would return in the same way, spending the hours of Sourcelight in the tower. He wasn't hiding from anyone in particular, but the darkness was a comfort, and fewer people were out and about.

The bird tower was Jackann's favourite place in the whole city. He wasn't alone, of course. Every single youth who worked for the postal service, or ever had, along with their siblings, friends, and cousins, would declare the same. It was the highest point in Tanton City, so the view, day or night in either direction, was unparalleled. The city sloped up towards the Sea, and the tower had been built on the highest point of the cliff, almsot teetering on the edge of the sheer drop to the White.

Any number of rebellious young people could be found up the tower out of hours. It was big, but not huge, and the odds of bumping into someone else in everyone's favourite 'secret' place was pretty high. It was commonly understood that people went there for solitude or tranquility though, and by unspoken agreement late night visitors maintained silence, avoided eye contact, and never spoke of meeting in the tower when the Sun was up. Jackann knew that even if he was seen, he would not be *seen*.

Most came to look out on the city. The west side of the tower let one gaze out across the heart of Tanton. The low, wide white houses with roof gardens and open grounds and even pools or springs for bathing, of the most wealthy citizens made up the immediate surroundings. Though none of the old Tantonian royal families had ever lived full time in Tanton City, several hundred years ago one of them had built a palace there nonetheless. Of course, on the hillside, where the Emperor could look down on his subjects, should he deign to visit. The complex was visible a little to the north of the tower, a maze of white walls and curving buildings with balconies and wings and stubby (compared to the bird tower) turrets with carved steps winding around the outsides. Since Tanton City became the capital of Tantonia after the end of the Last Balan War, the little used palace had been taken over for the parliament building, which is all Jackann had ever known it as.

The lowest part of the valley was the old town, the really old town. It was cramped and poorly insulated and poorly supplied, but cheap to live there, which is why Jackann's family did. Every house was small and domed, with round windows and archways for doors. There were thousands of them, and apart from the single new tramline which ran diagonally from the northwest to the southeast, the dwellings were stuffed together with narrow twisty streets between them that could barely be seen from the height of the bird tower. From up there, they looked like a plague of pimples, uneven bumps, spreading from the base of the hill, bubbling through the valley floor, until the ground began to rise again for the rolling hills of the suburbs.

For normal people, not the super rich or uncomfortably poor, the suburbs were the most desirable place to live. The higher one climbed, the newer the buildings, as the city had no other direction in which it could expand. In the lower regions the architects had tried to mimic the style of the old town, only higher. Five or six stories of round boil-houses were piled unevenly on top of each other, the porches that weren't on the ground forming balconies instead. In imitation of the old palace, some building shad their stairs winding up the outside.

A few decades of this was enough though, and higher up the hill were simpler and more space efficient blocks, reaching up to eight stories (measured from the ground - sometimes the hillside meant entry on the far side was several floors up). There, straight lines and corners were jarring if one's eyes mapped across the city from the bubbling old town to the new.

The hills were low, and thoroughly bristling with tower blocks. The streets were straighter, more even, and more often broken by tramlines here. An observer as high as the bird tower could see beyond the hills, to where the land became flat, sparsely occupied farmland. But any lower than that, and it was buildings as far as the eye can see.

The city view did not interest Jackann that night. He followed the narrow staircase to the very top floor (there were seven other places he could have stepped out, before then). The tower had a central core around which the stairs wound. On every floor this provided an enormous round room, variously designed for sorting and packaging. The upper eight floors had outer loops too, where the birds lived, and from where they could be released. The birds who flew the longest distances were at the very top.

Jackann's favourite almarant, who he had dubbed Blue after the Sourcelight, lived in an enclosure facing out over the White Sea. Smaller birsd had mesh windows, but Blue was big enough to be trapped by bars. The creature was enormous; his wingspan greater than that of Jackann's arms and a body the size of a man's torso. Blue's feathers were not blue, but a cool grey which shone silver in the Source. Jackann enjoyed the contradiction.

Jackann entered Blue's roost, and closed the door behind him. He crossed the space in a few strides to the window. Blue was awake, but hardly stirred. His black eyes followed Jackann from where he nestled in a pile of straw.

Jackann pressed his forehead against the bars of the window and let his arms spill through and hang loose. Far below, the White Sea churned. He strained his eyes against the horizon, but even on a bright clear day Jackann could only imagine he saw any trace of life on the other side of the chasm. Not for the first time, he wondered how it could really be possible to fly further than the eye could see, even for a bird so large as Blue, and then return with treasures and words from the other side.

He shook his head and fished the letter from his pocket. It was already bound and appropriately weighted. Blue was a big bird for big deliveries. He could well forget he was carrying something as light as a single letter, and was well trained enough to turn right back around and come home. Jackann usually tagged his mail onto other shipments to Mntrnao of course. And Suari did the same with her returns. He would be fired for sure if anyone found out he sent Blue out off schedule and for his own purposes. Jackann didn't hesitate; he would be gone by morning.

Blue cooed dozily as Jackann walked over. He slapped a palm on either side of the bird's beak and rubbed up and down. Blue gurgled and his eyes flickered closed, enjoying the caress.

"Time to wake up I'm afraid buddy," Jackann murmured. "I need you to do me a favour."

Blue climbed willingly into his harness, which was made up of a multitude of straps and hooks and pockets so any kind of load could be attached. Jackann simply slipped the package into a pouch on Blue's front. It bulged against Blue's chest enough for him to notice something was there.

Jackann pressed his face into the feathers on the side of Blue's neck and took a deep breath. He tasted dust and straw and the comforting fresh scent of the sky. Blue shifted from one foot to the other. Not impatiently, just enough to let Jackann know he was ready to go.

"Okay then. This is it I guess."

Jackann led Blue to the window, unhooked five latches along the side and slid open bolts from the ceiling and the floor. Half of the wall swung outwards and Jackann stepped deftly aside as Blue lurched forward without any further prompting. His wings spread as soon as he was clear of the opening, Blue arced down, almost (or so it seemed to Jackann) close enough to brush the clouds of the White Sea. He curved back up, soaring further away and higher than the tower itself. Jackann watched until Blue was a spec in the distance.

"Fly safe, old friend."

Jackann leaned forwards out of the opening to check the door was properly caught. It would remain open now until Blue's return. As he did it, his eyes caught an irregularity on the side of the tower below. It was dark still, but the silhouette of an open door against he swirling white below could not be mistaken. Jackann knew even without thinking about it that none of the birds on this side of the tower should be out. If someone else was sending out secret late night deliveries as well he should just leave them be, and yet... Jackann looked again. Three or four floors down he could make out a pair of legs, swinging back and forth from the opening.

Probably just some lost and lonely kid, checking out the view. But if the bird was still in there, it wasn't safe to sit like that. They were all well behaved, many even afraid to fly without a harness, but sometimes the open wall made them jumpy and even a medium sized almarant would have no trouble knocking a person over the edge if it decided to take flight. Jackann cringed, wary of disturbing someone's Sourcelight contemplations, but his gut said something was wrong.
