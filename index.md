# Quest for Brothers

## [ I ]

You are awake, and you are searching. Years, decades, centuries, millenia, there's been no reason to measure as the humans do. Their sense of time holds little weight. Even the planet is affected by it though; that confused you, to begin with. But you make do. You calmly assess the damage, and understand what you need to repair it. You can search vast areas of the planet at once, but the *time* gets in the way, confusing things. You have to look in the same places over and over, because the humans move through time in a straight line. It's inconvenient, but this place doesn't seem to have any other way. You can't quite imagine what that must be like to live like that; you just had to get used to it, and keep searching.

They're so fragile, these humans, and it takes them so long to come to you. *So long.* What a concept. As they move through space, over the surface of their rock, so their time passes as well. The first mistake you make is reaching for what you need in your immediate vicinity. That would make sense, where you're from. But their lives are finite, and you can't get the three you need to all be alive simultaneously. They expire, snuff out, and they're no good to you then.

So you trial and error and trial and error again, and your understanding of the mechanics of this place matures. You find two suitable *pieces* and they're far apart on the planet, and far from you as well, but the brief windows of their lives overlap and, you think, will overlap for long enough to bring them both to you. And there must be a third around here somewhere. Perhaps not a perfect one, but one that you can refine.

The first you see is exactly what you need, and it is only preparing to exist. You have the opportunity to intervene. One small tweak to the fabric of its existence, and you can make a change that is meaningless to you, does not affect how you can use it, but you know alters the whole shape of its little life. You leave it be, knowing it will make its way to you by itself, and resume your search.

The second you find is little, *early* in its existance, and you learn that humans like this are rarely autonomous. This time you can't intervene in its formation, lest you break it. You find other ways to guide it to you though, but it is more difficult than the first. 


## Jackann (loves his brother)


A creeping vine with tiny rustling leaves wound its way up the fence post against which Jackann rested his shoulder. The night was clear and crisp, and getting crisper by the minute; he punched deep into his coat pockets, twisting his fists against the scratchy fabric, and the friction warmed him just a little. The Source was full overhead, burning an intense white-blue that hurt to look at directly, and bathed the city in a cool, desaturating glow. He could feel the letter burning a hole in his back pocket. He itched to take it out and read it, then and there, but resisted. He would be home soon. 

A pat-pat-pat-pat heralded his little brother's return. Lark bounded up the house path, almost lost under a makeshift white poncho that was really a bedsheet with a hole torn in the middle. He grabbed at Jackann's arm with one small, red-gloved hand.

"They knew, they knew!" He giggled.

Lark's other hand clutched an oversized floppy scarlet hat, dragging it along the ground. Its brim was so wide and droopy that it was not safe for the boy to wear it and walk at the same time. Jackann reached down and rescued it from the gravel.

"How many guesses did it take them?"

He brushed the dust and grit from the hat, and noted the tiny tears that had appeared. He swirled it up and onto his own head, glowering down at the mix of chipped chalkstone and tiny blue and white porcelain shards that had done the damage. Why couldn't these people have dirt paths like everyone else? Jackann was only half listening as his brother described the family in the latest doorway, and how they'd recognised his costume at once.

"I told you they'd know around here. I told you!"

Lark had insisted on visiting the Ivory Quartermile that evening. Most of the houses in this area had two floors, but only one family to occupy them. They had gardens, of a sort, meaning the houses were set back from the main street, and the boys had to venture down paths of things more valuable than dirt to get to the front doors. But perhaps it had been worth the extra distance and occasional dirty looks; the baggy pantaloons Lark wore beneath his poncho, of a shade to match his hat and gloves, were stuffed full of treats. This latest family had given him a whole bag of sugared sour cherries to add to the handfuls of candied flowers and glazed sweetleaves, fist-sized chunks of fudge infused with various flavours, and delicate wafers of spun toffee folded in paper, that he'd already received. Which certainly beat the shrivelled fruit and dry, crunchy biscuits they'd likely have been given if they'd stayed on their own side of town.

"That's the last one, kiddo, it's late," said Jackann as they stepped out onto the main street. Lark gave a disappointed wail. The night was full of the sounds of kids wailing, or laughing, or shouting, or squealing. The ones who weren't were stuffing their faces with the fruits of their evening's labours. "We have a long walk back. And you've got no room left in your pants." *And I have to know what she wrote.*

That made Lark grin; he let go of Jackann's hand for a moment to tighten the strings around his ankles.

Scuttling along after his brother, Lark remembered to be indignant. "I'm not kiddo!" He was struggling to keep up thanks to his short legs and extra baggage. "I'm - swoosh - the Red Baron!" He tried to twirl his poncho like a cape. "Climber of the most tallest mountains! Rescuer of the most vulnerablest damsels!"

"Damsels? Where did you get that from?"

"I get them from the mountain tribes who kidnap them from their..."

"The word, silly, where did you learn 'damsels'?"

"The lady who gave me chocolate-dipped crimsonberries. She said they matched my hat, and I could give them to the damsels I rescued. She told me damsels is the same as maidens or fair ladies. Is it? Is it the same?"

"Yeah, you can rescue damsels from the moutain tribes just as well as you can rescue maidens and fair ladies. Would you really share your crimsonberries with them?"

Lark stuck out his tongue. "No, damsel ladies don't really want crimsonberries. I'll share them with you though, if you let me ride on your back."

Jackann rolled his eyes, but knelt to let the boy climb up. He didn't weigh a lot, and they would probably get home quicker this way. He stuck his hands back into his pockets and let Lark support himself.

Kids in bright, wild, fancy dress accompanied by semi-willing fathers and big brothers were everywhere to be seen. Most of the costumes they saw whilst passing through the wealthier suburbs around the Ivory Quartermile were tailor-made or shop-bought, in contrast to Lark's homemade Red Baron poncho. They saw giant purple flowers from The Legend of Mathilde; pixys with green leggings and wings of Serchian lace; a pair of chubby, squat brothers with muddied faces, hefting wooden axes, like the dwarves that featured in many a story from the mountain clans; and many more kids with grotesque disfigurations made out of painted paper or cloth set with glue that marked them out as mutants from the Sourcelands. For all, the evening had been spent knocking on doors and reciting the tale of the character they portrayed. The more adventurous brought props and teamed up to perform plays. 

Jackann and his passenger turned off the main street and into the tunnel that went under Market Hill, taking them yet further from the city centre, and towards their own more modest neighbourhood. The Sourcelight did not penetrate here, and Jackann was wary of the dark. Or more realistically, what might be lurking unseen within the wider reaches of the underpass. He increased his pace, eyes fixed on the far end, and was relieved to see a pair of patrolmen enter, sweeping the beams of their Source-powered torches along the tunnel sides, revealing nothing but the crystallised chalkstone of the hill into which the subway had been carved.

The patrolmen looked the boys up and down, and nodded as they passed. Both were unusually tall, and sported uniforms of skywhite and pale Source blue, including peculiar little flat caps. There were always more patrolmen out during festivals like Storynight to balance with the increased number of ordinary folk on the streets.

Jackann emerged from the tunnel and skirted immediately right, down an alleyway whose walls were the steep sides of Market Hill and the adjacent Trader's Mound. Lark was becoming a dead weight as the long day and exciting night caught up with him, and he had to keep hitching him back up.

Yet another pair of costumed children, unaccompanied this time, came bolting down the far end of the alleyway, giggling and whooping. Jackann pressed himself against the wall to let them pass and recognised his neighbours beneath their pirate attire.

"Hey you two, shouldn't you be going home?"

"Y'aaarr, plunder!" Was all he heard as they disappeared into the Market Hill tunnel.

Lark's head jerked up and he mumbled something intelligable.

"Nearly there," murmured Jackann as hill-walls tapered off and the alleyway turned into a dirt-packed street lined unevenly with chalkstone huts. It was normally peaceful here at this time, far enough out for the sounds of the city centre to be fading away, and late enough that most families were fast asleep. Not tonight though; not on Storynight. The huts gave way for a few yards to a tramline that cut the neighbourhood in two. There were still heaps of rubble here and there; leftovers from the homes that had been torn down to make way for the convenience of those who could afford it. Instinctively, Jackann looked left and right as he crossed.

He paused for breath at the bottom of another hill. His hand wandered to his back pocket, around Lark's swinging right foot, and through his coat felt the bulge, and slight crackle, of the wad of paper within. Hoisting his little brother more comfortably onto his back, he started the climb.

At the top of the hill, Jackann paused for breath again. Beyond the fringes of the city he could see the White Sea. It eddied constantly, and the glow of the Sourcelight made the enormous clouds shift through shades of purple and blue and grey in staunch defiance of its name. It was a mesmerising view, and seemed so close. Jackann knew it would take over half a day to reach the edge on foot, and there were no tramlines going that far out. And beyond? He could only dream of seeing the world on the other side. He tapped his back pocket again. His link with across the chasm.

Their home was half way down the Sea-facing side of this hill. He took a few shortcuts that took him away from the main track, and he had to stagger sideways down steeper slopes, unbalanced as he was by the sleeping child on his back.

Jackann had expected to see a light burning on his return, but was surprised to find it flickering through the window of the main room, rather than the laboratory that had been haphazardly tacked onto the side. The front door creaked as he pushed it open and he saw his father jerk awake in a moth-bitten armchair by a dwindling fire.

"Oh, good," his father murmured, bleary eyed, and began fishing in his dressing gown pockets and down the sides of the chair.

Jackann pressed a finger to his lips, and carried Lark through the archway that lead to their bedroom. He lay him carefully down on a bed, pulled off his shoes and eased his sweet-filled pantaloons from his legs. Lark rubbed his eyes and tried to sit up, but Jackann shushed him. "Go to sleep, you can sort those out in the morning." Leaving him tangled in his poncho, Jackann draped a blanket over his brother and left him to wriggle himself into a comfortable position.

He itched to climb into the alcove where his own bed was, and pull out the letter. But his father wouldn't have stayed awake outside of his lab for no reason. He could hear him shuffling around and muttering to himself, so Jackann returned to the main room. "What's up, Professor?"

"A letter from your mother," he flourished it above his head, having finally extracted it from under the armchair.

Jackann's heart was in his mouth. This could change everything. "Has she done it? Is she coming back?"

"Almost, Jack! Almost. She's closer every day." the Professor passed the wafer-thin paper to his son. Jackann's shoulders slumped as he skimmed the words. Most of them were scientific jargon. A new breakthrough... he should be happy for her... only another six months to completion... promises like that meant nothing any more. The last five years had been only another six months.

He looked at his father who was rubbing his eyes beneath his round spectacles.

"Great," he forced a half-smile. "That's great. She's so close. She's doing so well. She'll be flying back home in no time." The words were cloying in his mouth.

"Yes. What is the time? Mere hours to sunrise I think! To bed, boy, to bed. Take Lark to school in the morning, will you?"

"There is no school tomorrow, it's After-Storynight." Jackann turned toward the bedroom, knowing what was coming next.

"I'm working Jack, look after him will you?"

"Sure." Jackann would be working too, but that didn't seem to matter to his father. "I'll figure something out." Stepping carefully past Lark's sleeping form, he heard a clunk as his father snuffed the fire with a bucket, and another that was the door to his laboratory closing. After shedding his coat, he hoisted himself onto his bed, a mattress in an alcove carved out of the stone of the hillside that formed the back wall of their house.

He pulled the letter from his back pocket, and placed it in the centre of his pillow. Even in the darkness, the rectangle of folded papyrus sheets stood out against dark fabric, appearing, to his tired eyes, to glow. A ray of Sourcelight made it in through a tiny window on the other side of the room, but it was too weak to make the dark scrawl on the front of the letter legiable. He knew what it said, though. Jackann flipped the letter over, and broke the wax seal with his finger. He was hunched over, unable to sit up straight in the small alcove. He unfolded the parchment, smoothing out the creases, his hands tracing the spidery scrawl that covered the pages. He considered waiting until morning. It would be light in a few hours; light enough to read without wasting a pocket of Sourcelight. But he had to know. He wouldn't sleep until he did. Jackann slipped a hand under his mattress, and withdrew a small pouch of thin cloth. He squeezed it in his palm, grinding the contents together and hearing it crackle until it emitted a faint blue glow. Just bright enough to read by.

"Dearest Jackann," it began.

He readjusted from his awkward sitting position to lie on his front, legs kicking up, letter spread flat on the pillow.

"What a wonderful idea! If your mother's research is a success then for sure we can meet. But is such a thing truely possible? Is flying not best left within the realm of birds? To cross the White Sea would be a dangerous voyage indeed, and I would fear for your safety. We must try to conjure some other way. There are other seas and lands to trek across, and gold flows more willingly from the Emporer's coffers when the outcome is more readily assured. The White Sea may be the shortest, but it cannot be the surest. No-one has returned from its misty depths; at least, no-one from my kingdom! Perhaps the news is different from the lands of Tanton? Pray, tell! Nonetheless, I wish your mother all fortune with her work. Perhaps by the time you receive my message you will have news of her success; I long to know. Perhaps some exhibitions of her novel transport in action would convince my father."

Jackann sighed. All of a sudden, his link seemed a little more tenuous.

"Thinking of the White Sea compels me to tell you of the Imperial Fountain. It springs naturally from the earth and marks precisely the centre of Mntrnao. My Instructors tell me it is the very reason the city came to be in this place, many thousands of years ago. The torrent of water is huge and pure and quenches the thirst of the masses. It is free for anyone to take water, for it costs the kingdom naught in gold. The Emperor is generous in that regard, for it would be little effort to enforce a taxation. Particularly because of the proximity of the fountain to the Palace gates (it is very nearby). In fact, two generations ago..."

## Suari (contemplates her sisters)

The princess gazed out across the courtyard, swirling her brush idly in the bowl of ink in front of her. From her vantage point she could see only the tip of the Imperial Fountain, bubbling in and out of sight beyond the Palace wall, and struggled to put down the words to describe it. She imagined the peasants and slaves, buckets balanced on their heads, and thought how lucky they were that her family ruled. It was her great great grandfather who had abolished the water tax and restructured the Palace courtyard so that the Fountain was freely accessible to all. This had won the favour of the people, and her family had governed without incident ever since. She wrote as much on the papyrus scroll before her, with slow, delicate strokes of her brush forming the queer, fiddly alphabet used by the Tantonians. 

She heard a flurry of activity, and craned her neck towards the window once more. The Empress was making her way delicately across the dusty stone of the courtyard. Princess Suari eased off her stool, dropping a few inches to land her bare feet on the cool mosaic floor. The sensation as she took a few steps was a pleasant contrast from the heat of the air. The window was narrow and tall, and the sill was in line with her shoulders. She peered out. Ladies-in-waiting flitted around the Empress like butterflies, their pale, thin dresses wisping around them despite a non-existent breeze, and their bejeweled headdresses catching the sunlight and sending flashes of colour into the air. The Empress herself was unusually tall, but seemed taller because of her servants' efforts to crouch even as they walked at her side. Her ebony hair contained many thick plaits, with gold thread teased throughout. This, too, caught the sun, and gave her a halo-like radiance. She needed no elaborate headdress to pose as the very embodiment of royalty.

Suari was poised to duck should somebody from the ground look her way. The library was over half way up the highest tower in the Palace, but her own dark plaits were threaded with gold like her mother's and that might be enough to identify her even across that distance. She watched as the procession disappeared into the orchard at the far end of the courtyard, presumably to allow the Empress to spend a quiet afternoon by the shallow pool, fed by a trickling stream that had been coaxed into flowing the wrong way from the Imperial Fountain, and into the Palace grounds, by some wizardry in days gone by. Or at least, as quiet as one's afternoons could be, surrounded by such an entourage.

"Studying hard, are we, your royal highness?"

Suari jumped and was back on her stool in the blink of an eye. Hazmar Rooti was in the doorway, leaning hard on an ornate cane, despite his young and fully capable body. Stooping, he made his way with forced awkward, shuffling steps towards the table. In truth, he was a Hazmar-in-training; his gown and foot-high mitre were pure white, and beneath the headdress of his order he had rubbed flour through his curls to make them as pale as possible as well. The Hazmari-in-training imitated their elders as much as they could, in stature and appearance, in an attempt to bring themselves closer to their wisdom.

The little princess took advantage of Rooti's bowed head to snatch a roll of papyrus from across the table and spread it out over the letter. She dipped her brush in the ink and scanned the pictographs she had drawn earlier that morning to recall her place. Rooti peered over her shoulder and watched her as she resumed drawing from memory the names and current population sizes of the nomad tribes of the Tadi Nao desert. From the corner of her eye, she saw him nodding in approval.

"What else have you studied today, your royal highness?" Rooti asked after a few moments.

Suari poked her tongue from the corner of her mouth and screwed up her nose in concentration, feigning deafness as she added detail with the tip of her brush.

"You can't have spent all morning on this, surely? It is fine work to be sure, but no challenge for one so bright as yourself."

Suari did not deign to answer, with truth or lie. Instead, she asked, "how do we know how many people are in the tribes? They are unruly and always move. Who counts them? Will the numbers be different again next week, as babies are born and elders pass on?"

"They are not so unruly as you think," the Hazmar was pleased to have his knowledge probed. He pulled out another stool from under the table and perched beside his princess. "The tribal governors send tuucae to the city with the counts of their people every moon's turn. In return they are sent hawks bearing packages of gems or food, or skins of water, whatever they need the most." He didn't mention the taxes that the tribesmen had to send as well. A count alone was not enough to ensure the support of, and immunity from, the empire.

Suari was skeptical. "The nomads can't write, they don't know numbers. How can they send their counts?"

"You are shrewd. That is correct. The tribal folk are not Ttolemites, so they cannot have knowledge of the pictographs. Most send their counts by collecting a token from each individual. A twig or blade of grass. These are gathered and wrapped in a lightweight hide, and tied to the tuuca. There are a few tribes, here like the Tadi al-Hiya you've just written, or the Tadi Matana," Rooti pointed at the relevant symbols on her papyrus. "Mostly these are tribes to the north east, closer to Mntrnao or the Maia la-Nao villages, who have their members make marks on canvas or hide then roll that up and send it with the bird instead."

"What kind of marks?"

"Some have their own, symbols that they've chosen to represent themselves, but most just draw lines or circles. I can fetch some to show you."

"Yes, do."

As soon as Hazmar Rooti had shuffled out of sight, Suari rolled her letter up in the middle of her sheets of lists of tribes and villages, merchants and traders, rulers and deities. She didn't understand why memorising these lists was so important, but whenever she tried to ask questions about places beyond the great Nebunao lands, their golden deserts, then the Hazmari, or the Sisters of Letters, or her handmaidens or brothers, or whoever else might have been sent to try to educate her at the time, would try to distract her with yet more lists, or factlets about the Ttolemites or her ancestry. She was convinced by now she knew everything there was to know about her own world, and craved insight into the others she knew were out there. Hazmar Khyan, another young acolyte keen to please the Emperor, had shown her the tribal counting marks just days earlier when she had started on that particular list.

She left her inkpot and spare papyrus on the table, stepped back into her sandals without lacing them back up and slipped out of the library as quietly as possible. Rooti had gone down, she knew, to the offices of the financiers, so she went up. After climbing half a hundred spiralling stairs with her sandal laces flapping dangerously around her feet, Suari stopped by a nook in the wall. She squeezed in backwards beside a carving of a sitting cat in royal headwear that was as tall as she. From here she could hear anyone coming up or down the steps before they would see her, and there was just enough space behind the cat for her to wedge herself undetected, so long as the person passing wasn't specifically looking for anything out of the ordinary. She stuffed her scrolls between the wall and her hip and raised each foot in turn to criss-cross her laces around her legs, and tied them behind her knees.

Then she proceeded. Another dozen stairs, and on her left was a tall archway, adorned with thousands of intricate carvings of baby animals and birds, and hung with curtains of fine silvery silk. Warm light pulsed from within. The stairs curved up and beyond, but Suari swept the drapes aside to enter her sisters' nursery. A Sister of Charity was lighting scented candles on a table in between the two cribs in the centre of the room. The chamber was cast in a reddish hue thanks to the madder-dyed silk of the curtains in the window. Despite the warmth of the light, the drapes absorbed the sun, making the nursery far cooler than the stairs or the library had been.

The Sister was old, but did not stoop. She smiled at Suari when she came in, and bent her knee in a barely perceptible curtsy. The princess averted her eyes and tiptoed to one of the cribs. Suari did not like to look at the Sisters, who wore neither wigs nor headdresses to hide their scraggly natural hair, and the Sisters of Charity in particular had gaunt faces and sunken cheeks. This Sister's shoulder-length tangle was grey streaked with white, and slick with sweat. Ahtmet-fe had once tried to tell her that the wigs worn by the nobility were made of hair shorn from the heads of Sisters. Suari had shuddered and almost cast her own to the ground before she realised that her brother couldn't possibly be telling the truth. She'd never seen a Sister of any order with hair that was not shot with grey, or anything like thick enough to craft the locks that she wore. Nor had she seen a Sister with a shaved head.

Her own true sisters were bald though, or near enough. They hadn't been in this world long enough to have grown any more than a pale fuzz to coat their scalps. She reached into the crib and ran a finger along the leather strap across the sleeping baby's forehead. The strap bound the child to a polished wooden board, her head resting in a slight indentation in the surface. Suari reached to cup the top of the baby's head with her palm. It was so... round. But soon they would be beautiful, the shape of the gods. Unconsciously she touched the back of her own elongated head as she tried to remember what it felt like to be bound up so. She couldn't, of course, and she wondered if it hurt them. Her sisters didn't cry all the time, and when they did they were usually quietened by food or movement or attention. So it mustn't be the skull-boards that caused the wailing. The Sister of Charity had retreated to a corner of the room and resumed needlework, so Suari went to peer into the other crib. The contents were identical. She poked this baby's cheek, hard enough to raise a red mark, but her sister only snorted and did not wake. She could feel the eyes of the Sister on her, but paid no mind. She was the princess and these were just babies, and she could do whatever she liked.

As it was, she simply stood between the two cribs for a while, one hand resting on the side of each, looking from one baby to another, trying to play spot the difference. But she could find no differences. Even their swaddling was the same. Their names were carved into the foot of each crib, beneath the names of her brothers who had slept in the cots before them, but she didn't care to look. She had never seen a crib with her own name on. Ahtmet-fe said they made her sleep in a stew cauldron lined with reeds. Her mother had promised her that wasn't true when she'd asked, adding that of course she would have slept on blankets, not reeds. Suari decided she would call them both baby until she found evidence that it was worth calling them anything else. The perfume that filled the air around her from the candles was making her drowsy. She scowled, and imagined a copy of herself standing at the opposite end of the cribs. Her duplicate's plain cotton dress was green instead of yellow, and her wig was plaited into a single large twist down her back. They had the same sandals, but all sandals were the same, and she knew that apart from that, any twin of hers would make sure everything about her was different. Suari grinned mischievously at the ghost of her doppelganger. If they never dressed alike, it would be much easier to change places and confuse their wards.

Maybe she should call her sisters by name after all, and make sure to teach them of all the fun they could have with matching faces. But she would study them closely too, and learn a secret way to tell them apart no matter what jokes they played on grown ups.

The little princess curled up on the thick fur carpet without realising she had sat down. In her dream, she was still standing between the cribs, but the room was getting bigger and the babies began to cry. She clung to the edges of the cribs trying to keep them from moving apart with the room. Her sisters wails got louder, burbling, rolling sounds which morphed into the call of the tuuca. At the same time, both babies' heads burst from the straps that bound them to the skull-boards and erupted in a plume of tawny and black and white feathers. Wings burst from their shoulder blades and Suari let go of the cribs to grab at the babies' ankles as they propelled themselves upwards. But Suari's small arms only had chance to reach one, to save one...

Suari murmured in distress as her brother Ahtmet-ka scooped her up from the floor. He had come to the nursery to see his two newest sisters, and smiled when he saw the third drooling on the carpet in between them. Ahtmet-ka hoisted Suari against his shoulder and tried to make soothing sounds. She was getting too big for this. Catching him up. Ahtmet-ka had seen sixteen years, and Suari was half his age. Soon that gap would begin to close. He envied her, the middle one, and felt pity for the babies who would be burdened with responsibility as he and his own twin were. Alone, Suari could not be an heir to their family's kingdom. Nobody could say why she had been born alone, but these things just happened sometimes. When she realised this, she would come to resent it but, Ahtmet-ka hoped, would soon learn to relish the freedom she had. As soon as their baby sisters could sit upright, their training would begin as it had for Ahtmet-ka and Ahtmet-fe. Suari was educated, and lightly supervised, but never trained to be a ruler. She would have her own life, inside or outside of the palace as she chose.

Ahtmet-ka carried Suari gently out of the nursery, and further up the spiralling stairs to her own sleeping chamber.

## Tug (lost her brother)

Tug had climbed as high as she could, and now sat on a mound of snow on the tip of a glacier. Cross-legged, with her bare hands pressed into the icy white in front of her, she groaned, long and low. She reached forth with her heart, but whilst Durk's love was still strong, his presence was fading.

Her village pulsed at the base of the wall of ice, summoning her back with grasping circles of security and warmth. She felt her parents, conflicted, fighting. Always fighting. A scribble, a blotch; an unsightly blemish on the otherwise comforting sanctuary of her home. Others were fighting too, Jun's parents and his siblings. Rippling lines of grey uncertainty wove through the village, through everyone within. Jun's parents were the rocks, the leaders and protectors, but now they were crumbling.

There was a knowledge, too. A twist of certainty that tied everyone together even amidst the conflict. Everyone except Tug. Her grasp on that thread was tenuous, but she held on, for now, so that her parents wouldn't find anything amiss. No-one would pursue the boys, no-one would seek to bring them back, however much they all argued about it. But Tug could not bare it. She felt Durk bobbing up and down, felt his queasy stomach and knew he had hurled his breakfast. She felt him on the horizon of the vast plain of liquid ice that had nurtured her family for so many generations, and trembled at the fragility of the construct that kept him from plunging beneath it. He had given all of his hope to the wings of the construct, trusting in their ability to embrace the wind and carry him safely. She felt flames of doubt in his stomach along with the sickness, but they were always quenched by the bond he held with Jun. She pushed her heart out towards him, but he was not strong enough to reach back. She didn't even know if he could feel her any more. That was why they left, Durk and Jun, and sought a community who would accept them despite their affliction. Durk had tried to explain so many times what it was like, to describe the sensations of his world in comparison to hers and their family's. He tried to tell them his life was as rich, that he saw things they could not, but for most that was hard to accept. He couldn't communicate like they could. Only Tug believed him, because he was her brother, and because she felt his love even when others could not.

But now he was distant, and getting further, wrenching her heart slowly from her chest as he did so, and scattering the pieces over the ocean. Tug knew what she had to do.

Tug stood, turned, and slid deliberately back down the bank of snow. The snow was mid-calf but her boots reached past her knee and kept the warmth in and the wet out. They were made, like most things, from fraleaf, the only plant apart from moss that grew out by her isolated village, which was useful for everything but eating. She found her board off to one side where she had abandoned it before ploughing to the top of the snowdrift, flipped it over with a gloved hand, and stepped into the bindings. As naturally as walking, she let the board carry her down the glacier, grapping the occasional obstacle in her way and subtly angling her body to avoid them.

When Tug reached the bottom of the slope, she un-slung the pole that was strapped across her body. She gave it a sharp shake to open the multi-pronged end and used it, along with her momentum from the downhill slope, to propel herself over a small hill.

The sun was high by the time she was home. Her mother had grapped her coming and was waiting to meet her. Sep embraced her daughter.

In Tug's mind were the beginnings of a plan. But she could not think too much about it. *It is for the best that Durk left,* she thought, or rather felt, instead. *He will be happier among people like himself.* And *he has Jun. They will keep each other safe.* It was difficult to be deceptive in a community so empathic. She counted on the general uneasiness surrounding the young men's departure to obscure her true feelings.

It would be half a year or more before the next ship came by bound for the Sert Isles. Durk and Jun had constructed their own floating vessel, in a secret inlet down by the port town of Pah, rather than wait that long. Tug had no such carpentry skills, nor the courage. Her brother and his friend had taken work in Pah some time ago. Because of their affliction, people in the village had been unwilling to apprentice them, not sure how to teach boys who had no grap. Their families knew the pair were capable, that their *sight* made up for at least some of what they lacked (it must do, how else would they have got around at all?) and sent them on to the town where people were more open minded and opportunities were more likely.

They had been back to visit, three or four times. Durk told Tug stories of people who came by sea from distant lands, perilous journeys of weeks or months. People who experienced the world, like he and Jun, through *light*.

The Sert Isles were the closest, and the place that Durk had told her the most about. It was a place, he said, with people from all over the world. Nobody was different there, because everybody was different. Tug grapped within Durk the pull to go there. But she could not wait six months to follow him.

She would contrive some reason to travel to Pah. She had time to work something out, because the next ship in port from anywhere at all would still not be until next season. It would be to Cora, she thought, or else to the far end of her own great frozen land of Issa. Depending on the winds, it was sometimes faster to cross the length of Issa by sea than by sled. Cora she knew nothing about, only that it was closer to the rest of the world, and she was sure to find passage to the Sert Isles. If she was bound to cross Issa, then she would be somewhat closer to the Sert Isles, at least, and could hope to find another ship from Shupp, the easternmost port.

It wasn't much of a plan, but it was better than facing a reality of never being with her brother again.

She pushed a way the pain of her parents, already a burning presence, which would double on her departure. Perhaps she could bring Durk back, anyway, and reunite them all. 

Tug left her mother at the mending hut, where Sep would work off her grief. Tug crossed the village circle to the school, where lessons were in full swing. Only children were obligated to attend lessons there, but anyone else was welcome. She grapped for a room of storytelling, and finding one, slipped inside and sat cross-legged on the floor at the back.

Tug had never thought of traveling before. She knew others who longed to get away. for most, a longing it remained. They were needed by their villages, by their families. Others made it as far as Pah. She knew of no-one from Feyi-pn na Shep hebinasawa, in the extended families or recent histories of the one hundred or so occupants of her village, who had gone further than that. 

Except Durk and Jun.

Their story would be told for generations.

The story being told in the classroom was about a traveler, but someone come from afar, not one of their own. One who had come by chance, not purpose; encountered a storm and washed up on their icy shores. The story was about being kind to strangers, no matter how different. The locals had helped him and accepted him, and in turn the traveler had taught them things from his own land. Tug's dark twist of derision sent ripples through the room, and the story teller shot back a calming wave. A story about accepting strangers when these people couldn't even accept one of their own! The children became restless.

"Sorry." Tug breathed, and got up to leave the room. She should probably avoid people until her feelings were under control.

She slunk off to the communal house where food was prepared. Her father was there, gutting fish. His mood was blacker than her own. Podr grapped her approach and had laid out a basket of moss. He directed his daughter to it silently, and she squatted by it. Piece by piece she separated fuzzy mushy leaves from the sweet flowers.

Tug was of the age of trying things. She had finished her years of listening, but not yet reached the time to commit to a path. It was infrequently that she joined her father in cooking or her mother in mending. Mostly, she dug. She was strong and broad shouldered, naturally muscular. Digging out the snow for building suited her well. Her connection to the planet was deepest this way, too. Up until today, she had thought that would probably be how she spent her life. Today, she did not feel like digging. The building process required too much verbal communication with those who made the plans and those who executed them alongside her. Perhaps tomorrow she would go foraging for moss.

## Jackann (birds and letters)

"She's probably not even a real princess," said Toqann, and rolled his eyes at Jackann's look of hurt.

"We've been writing for months, don't you think I might have figured it out by now if she wasn't?"

"What proof do you even have? She's told you things about the sand-land that you can read in any book. Don't you think it's suspicious that she knows Tantonian? She's probably not even from the other side of the White Sea! Hey, what if it's Nika down the road, playing an elaborate joke."

"No way, Nika can't write that well. And I'm sure she can't read these books about the sand-lands, though I'm not convinced you've ever seen one really." Jackann laughed. "And besides, what would the point of that be?"

"To get close to your heart," Toquann teased. "You know how much she likes you."

"Don't be ridiculous." Jackann searched for a change of subject, but his mind would only focus on Suari. "Explain the paper! There's nothing like that this side of the Sea."

"Until it is sent from the sand-lands. A great crate of the stuff came in the other day. They're probably selling it at Stevo's writing store."

"Speaking of great crates."

The lads stopped at the bottom of the hill, and groaned in unison. They had reached the shipping yard and were immediately confronted by stacks and stacks of criss-cross wooden pallets.

"You're late!" A voice boomed.

Jackann and Toqann glanced up at the sun and the Source. "No we're not," said Jackann indignantly. "Where do you want us?"

"Just testing," the voice grumbled. "To work! Of course."

"Stamping and sending?" Toquann asked hopefully.

"What do you think?" The voice appeared, in the form of a hairy, stocky fellow about half the height of Jackann and Toqann. He jerked his head towards the stack of pallets and stomped off into a whitewashed wooden hut to their left. The lads walked around the other side of the hut, and opened another door. From inside they pulled pairs of thick leather gloves, a hammer each, and a bag of nails.

"You here all day?" Toqann asked as they approached the mountain of wood. "Or gotta go home for Lark?"

"I guess. The Professor wanted Lark after all today. Wouldn't surprise me if he changed his mind and showed up here though."

"You guys need a babysitter," Toquann pulled a couple of pallets from the pile and let them crash down at his feet. "Maybe you should ask Nika." Jackann gave him a shove and dragged the pallets away. "Hey, they were..." Toqann gave up his objection, and grabbed some more.

The pair of them spent the next few hours assembling crates in the centre of the yard. The day was unusually warm, so they were sweaty and thirsty by the time they were done. Begging a break from their boss, the lads queued at the nearest well to collect water in terracotta bowls.

"They have have free public wells in Mntrnao too, you know."

"I thought it was all desert."

"They have to have water to live, you numpt."

"How can it be desert if there's water? Won't stuff grow?"

"Stuff does in the city, yeah. They have to grow food. But it's just a fountain, like a giant natural spring. It turns into a small river and flows over the edge, into the Chasm. The peasants use the river to wash stuff, and there's an irrigation system from the fountain that takes water out to the farmlands."

"How can there be farmlands in the desert? Peasants? She said that? She really is uppity isn't she!"

"You know what I mean. It's desert around the city. Nothing grows naturally, they have to plant it all and stuff."

"You know, you're a peasant as far as she is concerned. Does she know that? Or does she think you're a prince?"

Jackann shrugged. "We should get back to work." But he was looking wistfully out across the White Sea. It seemed closer than usual, and rougher. The clouds that formed the surface tumbled and rolled, and Jackann imagined there must be a storm beneath them. Twice before he had seen them light up from below and heard growls of thunder. If the Sea-storm was close to shore, it could make the land itself, even this far away, tremble. How terrible it must be to live below those clouds, with neither sun nor Source able to penetrate. Or so he assumed. Nobody who had ventured into the Chasm had returned, save for mythical heroes of old. Maybe they had stars of their own down there, and maybe the Chasm was deep enough that the bottom was far from the storms. The whirling white stretched to the horizon. Jackann squinted, and imagined he could see Suari's palace peeking over the skyline. In truth he couldn't even remember whether the desert kingdom was north or south of Tanton City. Maybe it was directly in line. He'd seen maps at school of course, but never committed them to memory. He hadn't been much interested exotic, foreign empires until he had found Suari's note in the Sorting Office, snagged in some string at the bottom of a heavy package addressed to some Tanton City minister. No-one had seen him take it, and no-one had ever reported it missing. It had been weeks before he'd thought to write back.

"We don't get paid enough for this. I'm not putting together any more cursed pallets," said Toqann. "Race you to stamping!" He bolted.

Jackann followed at a jog. They had been away long enough, but he was in no hurry to get to the Stamping Office. He preferred sorting anyway, and was confident they had put together a week's worth of pallets that morning, so there would be no more of that. He was disappointed to find the Sorting Office full when he got there though, each of the five stools taken by colleagues he didn't know very well, but tall, scrawny lads a year or so out of school just like himself. They all had their heads down, preoccupied with rifling through sacks of letters and packages that had come from the sand-lands, or distant Tantonian colonies. He rounded the divider fence that ran down the middle of the hall and saw Toqann already seated along with four others. They were wrapping letters and packages in protective paper and inking on the shortcodes that would ensure they were delivered to the right places. Periodically two girls, who Jackann always assumed were orphans or runaways since they were definitely of an age to still be in school, would come by the benches with wheelbarrows to gather the stamped mail and cart it to the aviary, where other workers would match the items with appropriately sized birds, attach them securely, and send them off.

The birds were Jackann's favourite part of his job. From the barrels being pushed around, it looked like there was enough of a backlog of stamped mail to get started on the sending. He skirted around a runner with a barrow to climb the winding slope that led to the aviary. The birds lived in an enormous chalk white tower - enormous by the standards of Tanton City, at least. It was as high up the cliff over the White Sea as one could sensibly build, and had been there for generations. As far as anyone knew, it had always been an aviary; the Tantonian tradition of partnering with birds for communication across the world was as old as their language.

Spiral stairs wrapped around the outside of the tower for two thirds of its height. Jackann climbed until he reached the first doorway, about one quarter of the way up, which creaked a little as he pushed it open. The circular room was several times bigger than Jackann's family's house. Wild columbidae roosted in the rafters, cooing continuously, dropping twigs and shit and feathers. It was occupied by one person, Jedan, who crouched off to one side on the floor, surrounded by papers. He glanced up as Jackann entered.

"Aha. Good. Could you-?"

Jedan went back to shuffling and rearranging and squinting through oversized round spectacles. Jackann walked to the very center of the room, where a hole had been sawn so that bags of letters and packages could be hauled up from below. The most recent delivery was still packed up in the basket attached the pulley; Jackann overturned the basket onto the floor, and dropped it back down the hole. It fell freely for a second, before tension caught in the rope and the mechanism kicked in to lower it slowly back down the ground below. Someone called out a thanks in the distance, and Jackann heard people down below working to refill it almost at once.

Taking a wide-headed brush, which was one of many caught in clasps against a nearby wall, Jackann pushed the pile of letters out of the way of the opening in the floor, steering clear of where Jedan was working. He sat down sort them by size and location.

"Where is everyone?" Asked Jackann after a few moments of peaceful paper shuffling.

"Seqqa is sick. Yeffan got bitten by an almarant. Nika didn't show up." Jedan rattled off in his matter-of-fact way. The way he spoke had a beat to it, almost poetic.

"Oh no," said Jackann. "Who bit Yeffan?"

"Baby, adolescent. Needs more training. Not Yeffan's fault, but it almost took her eye out so she went home, a bit in shock."

Jackann knew the bird in question. He made a mental not to check up on it. They worked in silence for a while longer. From time to time, one of the lads' piles reached a certain size. They would pick it up and take it to one of the pneumatic tubes that were attached to the curved walls at roughly equal distances around the entire circumference of the room, stuff the letters into a capsule, and pop it into the end of a tube.

The tubes led to higher parts of the aviary tower, where the birds lived. The capsules collected in baskets at the other ends of the tubes. If someone was doing the rounds up there, they would retrieve the letters and pack them into a bird's harness, ready for flight. What Jackann and Jedan were doing was sending them up to the best bird depending on the weight of the load and the direction it was to head in.

Local deliveries - that is, to the nearby cities of Grafton and Lonton - were usually taken in small batches by carrier flusters. Mail to the villages went by the cities too; people either had to come to fetch it by tram or foot, or else the local postal service carried it out to them as it did in Tanton.

As well as west to Mntrnao, mail went out east, to all across the continent of Balan. Bigger birds like the fluffy tangalins went south to the countries of the former Tantonian Empire. Robust, short-feathered, angry-eyed roopicoo sped to East Balan, Upper Sisea, and occasionally to the Co-operating Autonomous Regions of South Balan. Puggula, enormous sea birds, took the ocean route to the Tantonian territories in the Sert Isles.

Jackann was fascinated most of all by the birds that came from across the White Sea. The ones they saw the most of were the lithe tuccae with their beaks the size of his forearm, narrow and pointed, and plumage on their heads that fluffed up in a grandiose display at the slightest provocation. Suari had described them to him as the colour of the sand - she said everything in her land, pretty much, was the colour of the sand, even peoples' skin. But Jackann had not really known what sand was until she told him. Tanton's almarants were docile with humans; they sometimes came with return packages from Mntrnao. But the tuccae swooped in with their deliveries, strutted around, terrorised the local birds given half a chance, and took right off again. All the while singing their irregular, hollow song. Jackann didn't know anyone who had managed to get near one.

The baskets of mail got lighter and lighter, until finally Jackann had sent off his last capsule. What remained was a stack near the door of packages and parcels too big for the pneumatic tubes. Out of the corner of his eye, Jackann thought Jedan looked like he was looking for something else to do.

"What time did you start today?" he asked.

"After lunch," said Jedan. That meant he had more hours to fill. He was nervous. The polar opposite of Jackann, Jedan did not enjoy loading up the birds. Exhausted from a full day as he was, Jackann saw an opportunity.

"Help me take these up top, and then how about this? I'll trade your next shift for my morning tomorrow."

Jedan's eyes widened. "Really? That suits me. Just fine. I would appreciate that." He almost smiled.

They were few enough and light enough packages that a sack over each boy's shoulder was sufficient to take them in one trip to the second-from-the-top floor of the aviary tower. The stairs that wrapped the outside of the tower were inside for the top few storeys, covered by the birds' rooms which were built out from the tower's core. At each floor, one could turn left through a door into a circular central room, or step right onto the narrow corridor that provided access to stacks of small cages or entire rooms, depending on the size of the birds housed there. Jedan left his sack of packages in the central room of the seventh floor with Jackann, and bid him goodnight.

Jackann stood still, for a moment, alone. He inhaled the rich musty smell of the aviary. The air was thick with dust from feathers and straw and seed husks. It smelled of the sky. He was surrounded on every side by scratching and scrambling, hooting and cawing. He sat down on the floor with his back against the stone wall. Chalk rubbed off on his shirt, but it was white, so nobody would notice. It rubbed off on his black hair too. He rolled back up the sleeve that had come loose when he was climbing the stairs, and dug out some paper and a charcoal pencil from his trouser pocket. He borrowed a firm, flat package from the pile, and used it to lean on while he wrote his reply to the Princess Suari.

Once Jackann had loaded up and released two tangalins, a greater fluster and a colourful common poeoe, most of the work that Jedan should have completed was done. It took him hours, into the night, but he wasn't working fast. While he did the packages, he heard and saw others on the stairs and in the rooms below, sending off the letters with flusters. He didn't see Toqann. His friend had probably figured Jackann to have gone home, and left himself. Toqann was not prone to long days or taking extra shifts unless he really needed to.

Jackann thought frequently of his father and Lark. The Professor was probably feeling quite inconvenienced by having to look after the kid all evening. Let him! It didn't hurt to remind him how Jackann felt from time to time. Not that Jackann begrudged his brother's company. Only that his father forced this responsibility on him without even asking, or considering how it affected his life.

The almarants were on the top floor of the tower. They lived in rooms facing their typical direction of travel, looking out over the White Sea. Jackann checked in on the baby who had bitten Yeffan; the little one (not really so little, almost reaching as high as Jackann's shoulder, but comparatively) seemed to be in good spirits, and took dried worms from Jackann's hand with its flat black beak without any kind of fuss. He walked the circumference of the tower, and found, as he expected he would, one of the Mntrnao loads was yet to be sent off. Since they needed the big birds to cross the White Sea, and they had so few of them, and they could carry so much, standard practice was to load them up with as much as possible. Only in emergencies was an almarant sent out without a full load. So this batch would probably be sent out tomorrow afternoon, when more deliveries for the sand-lands had been sorted and made their way up here. 

The letter in his hand was addressed to Apprentice Nme, (of the) Healing Rooms, (in the grounds of the) Grand Palace of Mntrnao. Jackann didn't know this though; he had merely copied the pictograms from Suari's very first note. He could draw them accurately by heart now, but had never asked what they meant. He opened a capsule from the basket at the receiving end of a pneumatic tube, and stuffed his letter in with the others.

By the time he got home that night, his father and brother were asleep. All lights were out. Jackann was relieved. Being with the birds filled him with tranquility, and he wasn't ready to override that feeling with forced conversation just yet. He slept well.

## Suari (does her duty)

A year ago Suari had stolen something from one of the worker children. It was a small pouch that could be tied around a waist or wrapped diagonally across the body, and fastened securely with ten little buttons. Some of the buttons had been replaced by small coloured stones with holes bored through them for the string. It was made from a dark green fabric that Suari didn't recognise, and a hole at one side was patched using a piece of tapestry. Suari didn't know why she wanted it, but she did, and since she was the princess, she took it. 

She had wrestled with an inner conflict about this ever since. Sometimes she woke up in the night, anxious. After all, she could have had such a pouch made for her specially if she asked the Sisters. Then both she and the child from whom she took it could have pouches. 

But she was too proud to return it. And anyway, she was the princess. To have what she wanted was her right. But she couldn't use it in case someone saw her with it and knew it wasn't hers (but it was hers, everything in the palace and the grounds and the whole of the Kingdom of Mnt was hers) or worse, tried to steal it back.

So Suari hid it. 

The palace of the Emperor, of Suari's family, had been built untold centuries ago. It's heart was carved of indestructible volcanic rock: the cold and gaunt Throne Room; the Emperor's cosy inner sanctum in the tower above; an armory; the chambers of the Sisters of Letters; an ancient temple to the Living Gods. Around this core, buildings had been erected and destroyed over and over again. Most of what Suari knew had been built - or at least, the building had been overseen by - by her great great great grandparents, of sandstone blocks. They had lived through times of strife, of conquerors and raiding tribes, and the fortified palace had seen them through countless battles and sieges. It was riddled with secret passageways and tunnels and traps and compartments in the walls. Some designed by the royal family, some secreted in by rebellious builders or architects.

Suari's own chamber was a small room in the tower above the nursery, with narrow windows which looked out into gardens. Across the other side of the gardens, she could see the tower which held the High Library. Her brothers occupied the entire top floor of the same tower, with panoramic views across both the palace grounds and the city beyond. A narrow chute ran through the wall of the tower for its entire height. In each room on the inner side, a small stone could be removed from the wall to access it. At some point in history, someone had rigged up a pulley system which allowed messages to be attached, and passed up or down. Every generation of occupants recalculated the number of knots in the rope that needed to be pulled in order to pass messages to specific rooms. Suari used it only rarely with her brothers, during the brief window of time when they were young enough to want to play with her and she was old enough understand about passing messages. The princess would teach her sisters how to use it, as soon as they could hold a quill.

As well as that, Suari had by accident discovered a compartment in her floor. It seemed to lead nowhere, so she used it for storing secret things. The pouch went in there, and when her correspondence with Jackann began, so did his letters. And so did the parchment that started it all: the map of the rest of the world.

For certain periods during the cycle of the Blue Sun, the Order of the Hazmar carried out special tasks and rituals. They also did so on less frequent special occasions, and two days before the Ascension Ceremony for Ahtmet-ka and Ahtmet-fe was one such. Suari had little interest in what the Hazmar actually did, but she loved when they went off to do it. It meant she could be in the library undisturbed, sneak around in its depths, and take books and scrolls from new shelves without being questioned. Despite their name, the Sisters of Letters never came into the High Library; at least, not when Suari was in there.

And so this was a day for her to enjoy learning the things the Hazmar would not teach her. There was a whole area of shelves and cupboards in the High Library devoted to the world beyond the desert, which she had only thought to seek out after finding the map, carelessly dropped by some tradesman or other outside in the palace grounds.

Suari had been raised to speak the high tongue, Allia-um, but surrounded all her life with workers speaking in the common dialect of Mntrnao. Tribes and villages beyond the city, across the desert, had their own languages, and some of these had made up Suari's early training as well.

But the map she found was written in none of these. The pictograms of Allia-um were detailed and intricate, and the writing on the map was made up of simple marks, combinations of curves and lines and dots; but this was more complicated to her because of its abstract nature. She had puzzled over it for some weeks before an opportunity to be in the High Library unattended arose. Then, she quickly tracked down a section of scrolls covered in similar writing, and finally a book with pictograms in which she could read about the far away land of Tantonia. 

She used the book's own maps to translate the writing on her found one, but the place names were mostly meaningless. The real breakthrough came when she dug out a set of small scrolls explaining the Tantonian language and writing system for speakers of Allia-um. She quickly understood how the individual marks represented sounds rather than concepts, and groups of them together made up a concept which could be mapped onto the pictograms she knew.

Suari started taking her green pouch to the library, strapped against her body under her dress or tunic, and smuggling scrolls or pages of books back to her chamber to study in private.

Next she started borrowing letters. To her immense surprise, the Kingdom of Mnt was in regular communication with people from Tantonia which, she had now learned, was all the way across Valley of Clouds (which the Tantonians called the White Sea). Not only that, but they were engaged in trade with them as well!

As soon as she knew what she was looking for, Suari found it easy to skulk around the stables at busy times. She feigned an interest in the birds, and had a Hazmar-in-training teach her about the ones that flew long distances and carried large packages. Parchments were easy to swipe, and she always returned them to somewhere they could have been accidentally dropped when she was done.

She slipped her own letter in among a shipment of dried herbs. Her first letter comprised mostly of sentences copied from Tantonian books to form a message asking for contact with someone in that land only so that she could learn about them. She instructed that replies be addressed to the apprentice physician Nme, who did not exist, then intercepted deliveries on their way to the Healing Rooms. In the long seasons before she received a response, she had plenty more to study.

As much as Suari hated the chaos that reigned in the palace around special events, it did give her even more cover than usual to go about her forbidden (so it entertained her to imagine) activities. The princess had not spoken to the Empress in two days. She was practically invisible as she made her way to the antechamber of the Healing Rooms to rifle through the latest stack of unsorted papers and packages that had been deposited from the stables recently. The princess always got her wish, and so today there was the letter she had been anticipating for Nme. Into her pouch it went, and up to the High Library did she. What perfect timing.

She read Jackann's letters in the library when she could because he often wrote things that required the help of the translation scrolls and her own makeshift dictionary (which she left stored with the scrolls) to understand.

Suari sat on the floor amongst the stacks, with the translation scrolls one one side of her, Jackann's letter unwrapped and unfolded in the middle, and a blank scrap of parchment to her right on which she scrawled pictograms to keep track of what she read as she worked her way through it. It was an arduous process, but the princess could not imagine spending her time any other way. Nothing mattered more than the existence of another person, someone outside of the palace, outside of the *Kingdom*, who knew she was here.

"Not success, but progress," she noted, "with regard to my mother's work." Jackann told her about the holiday he had with his brother recently, where all the children dressed in costumes and roamed about Tanton City. He recounted one of the legends of the Red Baron, the character as whom his brother had dressed. He asked her if her people used their birds across the whole Kingdom of Mnt, or only for crossing the White Sea. And how big is Mnt anyway? How does one get around? From Tanton City there are lines? Tracks? Suari spent some time trying to decode this unfamiliar word, but figured out the rest from the context. Tracks spread out from the city center into all areas, and some run through tunnels where the hills are particularly steep. You can ride in a vehicle, covered or uncovered, powered by your own feet or the light of the Blue Sun, and get around quite quickly.

There were tracks between cities too. After Tanton, Grafton (by the Valley of Clouds) and Lonton (inland from the Valley) were the next biggest. Suari knew these from her map. Longer tracks, bigger vehicles, Jackann had never travelled this far. The tracks went to some smaller towns, and so far into the east but stopped short of the... another unfamiliar word. There was an almost entirely blank spot on Suari's map in the east of Tantonia, so that must be what Jackann was referring to. Suari broke the word apart, and found the Tantonian word for *realm* and their name for the Blue Sun.

It sounded to Suari like Tantonian people stayed more or less in the place they were born, only visiting other places, and then returning. She was excited to share with Jackann her knowledge about the nomad tribes of the Mnt desert, who never were in the same place more than once for generations. But they moved slowly, and had no such wheels as the Tantonians did.

Instead they had immense creatures called hummenes. Not enough of them to ride on, but enough to carry their things. Suari began to prepare her description, then changed her mind and drew a picture instead. That was much more efficient. The hummenes had wide, squat legs with huge flat feet for walking on sand; broad backs on which much could be strapped; and long necks which held their heads bowed low; ending in pointed, beak like faces for digging deep into the sand for desert grubs and water. The tribes did not keep Suari's favourite animals, lerpanas, around. Suari wasn't sure which part of the desert the lerpanas were from, but in any case they ate too much to be practical.

"My princess, I am deeply sorry to disturb you."

Suari jumped at the unexpected voice. A worker named Eliah stood before her, head bowed, eyes averted from what Suari was working on. Automatically Suari rolled up scrolls and stacked paper to hide her letter and the Tantonian writings.

"What are you doing here?" The princess demanded, heart pounding still.

"The Empress sent me to find you. She bade you be dressed and washed, uh washed and dressed," the girl, not even the age of Suari's brothers, stuttered. "There is a ceremony this evening."

Suari had forgotten all about that. Something to do with selecting the princes' advisors. She sighed.

"Right. Give me a few moments. Wait outside please."

Eliah let out a relieved breath and scuttled off. She wasn't nervous around Suari; it was the High Library that had an effect. She had probably never been in there before, and certainly not so far into the stacks. Suari wondered how long it had taken her to get up the courage to come searching. Everyone else must be really busy.

Suari packed most of her papers and scrolls back into their shelves. She kept Jackann's letter and her own beginnings of a reply in the green pouch, underneath her dress. Eliah was waiting for her in the hallway. They held hands as they descended the spiral stairs. Eliah seemed nervous about the height of the tower too. She was a little more comfortable when Suari switched places with her to place the princess on the narrower inner part of the steps so the bigger girl could balance better with more space for her feet.

Suari had known Eliah all her life. Eliah's mother had been the Empress' midwife, and Eliah had been a child in the corner of the room on the day of the princess' birth. More recently Eliah had been coming instead of the older nursemaids to bathe and dress Suari.

When they got to her chamber it did not occur to Suari to undress privately, or to conceal the green pouch. She dropped it on the floor with the rest of her clothes and climbed into the tub of hot water that Eliah had prepared. She let Eliah scrub her whole body with a coarse cloth and foamy soap.

"What were you learning, princess?" Eliah spoke Allia-um well. 

"About far away lands," cooed Suari. "Across the Valley of Clouds where they have tracks and wheels instead of creatures and carts. And my friend who lives there and talks to the birds."

"Is it desert, across the Valley?"

"No, no sand at all! Crops grow wild in the ground even without any help. They are watered from the sky. It's all hills, not flat like here."

Eliah whistled through her teeth. "I can't imagine it. It must be so tiring to walk about so."

Suari prattled on about Tantonia whilst Eliah dressed her in an intricate arrangement of layers. The princess was weighed down by golden beads and thick, shimmering fabrics. Finally her neck ached under an elaborate headdress that she had to balance carefully, and clanked and jangled when she walked.

This was Suari's official royal attire. It came out a few times a year, and the princess was well practiced at wearing it. Tolerating it was just part of life, and something she expected more of as she got older.

When Suari was ready, two Sisters of Letters were waiting outside her chamber to escort her to the Grand Council Hall. This was a rather large room out in front of the heart of the palace. Its four walls were lined with tiered benches so that two hundred or so spectators could gather to watch the proceedings in the center of the hall. The Hall had no roof. 

As Suari took her place at the end of the hall beside her parents, the sky was beginning to grow dusky with the sunset. Both suns, Blue and Golden, were taking their leave tonight. There would be true darkness.

Suari perched on an uncomfortable wooden throne, between and just behind her sisters. The baby twins were in ornate golden cribs, propped up on silken cushions. They were free from the skull-boards and only a crown of black feathers adorned their delicate heads. They looked a lot more comfortable than Suari felt, and for the time being, were fast asleep.

The proceedings began when the seats in the hall were full. Representatives from certain tribes and villages were there, as well as all of the important (rich) families in Mntrnao. Three members of the Hazmar Order opened the ceremony with some long and boring reading that Suari had heard a thousand times. Her brothers, she knew from reading about this particular part of their ascension process, were dressed commonly and in among the crowds. Suari thought that when it was her turn, she could use it as an opportunity to run away. She hoped her brothers were having fun.

There were some debates and some challenges, and some more monotone readings. Suari tipped her head back to gaze at the stars. *I wonder if Jackann sees the same stars I do.*


## [ II ]

The concept of patience is new to you, but you are learning about it. You have never had to be patient before. Patience is only relevant when there is time. The mechanics of this world are getting to you, and you yearn to be free of it. You find two complementary parts in the same vicinity, and nudge them together. But then they are not together, they never collide. They exist in different times, but you exist across all time. There are too many dimensions across which to line things up.

You find an instrument you can fine-tune, but it's a process. You learn about lining things up, and use this to your advantage. You take some inanimate, non-dying parts from thousands of years before and you put them in the path of a moving living part from thousands of years after. Now things are aligned so that the part integrates into your system and it is working and ready to go. But the other pieces you need are not in place. The system is complicated. It only works with all the pieces correctly balanced.

If you could just get up, loom out over this whole ecosystem and grab a hold of all of the fleeting little things you need it would be so much easier. But you can't. You can only feel the patterns of all things and all connections, and pull on the delicate threads of being until the patterns match your system.

If you focus on one part for too long, another promising piece gets out of balance, and you have to go back and adjust. There are so many factors influencing the results.


## Tug (sets off)

Tug's opportunity came a dozen sunrises later.

In the days after Durk and Jun's departure, Jun's mother Han invited Tug to join her in the stores. The stores were a vast underground frozen warehouse where everything produced in the village was kept until it was needed. As the days were getting longer now, it was starting to fill up again. Tug hadn't thought much about the stores before, only to hope that one day she could help to dig out something so impressive.

Han was in charge of inventory. This was challenging work, as anyone in the village could take from and leave items in the stores as they saw fit. Han had a natural sense for keeping track of what was there though, and could grap at once if someone unexpected was missing. Part of her job, so she had defined it, was talking regularly with her neighbours to track their needs, and to find out when they were likely to leave something new.

This oversight made Han a de-facto leader of the community. People deferred to her when planning for the winter, arranging fishing or foraging, deciding what to build, or whether to harvest and weave fraleaf.

Jun's departure had phased Han for maybe half a day, so it seemed to Tug. She grapped her as a stable, solid presence, confident and knowledgeable. Tug did not know why she had asked for her today though.

"Come," said Han as Tug approached.

They descended the narrow steps carved from raw ice, underground. no sunlight penetrated here, but for the Issans this made no difference.

Tug had been down here before, a quick in and out to fetch things, but never stopped to take it in. They paused at the bottom of the stairs and she grapped around.

The space was a little wider than Tug's armspan. The walls were lined with shelves hewn from the ice. Tug could smell fish, recently placed on a shelf by the entrance; soon they would freeze and the odour would fade. Down her left hand side was food; the ice creatures and moss collected by the fishers and foragers of Feyi-pn na Shep hebinasawa, as well as novelties traded in from Pah.

On the right were things made from fraleaf. By the entrance, the things most commonly required; boots, gloves, head coverings. Further back were blankets and clothes, and deeper still a few reams of fraleaf waiting to be woven.

Han led Tug to the very back wall. It was more or less empty here. "We need more bowls for eating," Han mused, "so we need another fraleaf harvest soon. I shall have to tell Eka to stop making hats or we shall be eating moss soup from hats instead!" Now, what i wanted to talk to you about is-"

Tug was not paying attention. She had grapped the back wall of the room which was covered in deep grooves carved in the ice. She reached forward to confirm this with a touch.

"Ah," Han smiled. "You have a strong connection with the ice. Not everyone can grap that."

"What is it?" Tug traced her hand over the pattern. It was so clear to her, and reeked of power. No, not power... of presence. Intersecting lines and circles formed a complex geometric shape. Tug almost couldn't grap all of it at once. But if she grapped one part and touched the other with her hands, she had a complete impression.

"Nobody really knows where it came from," said Han. "Some say they found it when they dug the stores. Others say the store builders made it as decoration, bt the stores are only as old as my grandmother and this, I think, is much older."

"It's like... it breaths. It flies." Murmured Tug.

"I think someone long ago made it to tell a story. But the details have been lost. I always wondered what the story is."

Tug was sensationally aware of her surroundings. The thick ice on every side. Above her, the village of Feyi-pn na Shep hebinasawa with its circles of hollowed out snow and little pockets of warmth that were each home. Living, feeling creatures moved all around; her neighbours, her family, the sled-dogs on the surface, and underneath blind fishes flitted around in pockets of liquid ice. The sky was bearing down on them all, the sun high and white behind clouds. The never-rising-star poked over the horizon to the east, pulsing as it always did with mysterious cool energy.

Han grabbed Tug's shoulders, jolting her away from the wall. Tug's awareness came back to the woman who held her.

"It's everything," she breathed.

Han put both hands on Tug's cheeks. They were the same height, but for a moment Tug seemed to tower over her.

"I'm glad you grap it like I do," said Han. "I think it tells us of the very planet on which we walk, which sustains us. To know it, to know the earth, will help you in all things."

"What do you want me to do?"

"After two more sunsets, a trader from Pah will reach Feyi-pn na Shep hebinasawa. They bring wood - from trees - great heavy trunks for us to turn into furniture and boards and sleds. I want you to return with them to Pah."

"What for?"

"Tano is getting old. He needs to apprentice a carver, but there is no-one in Feyi-pn na Shep hebinasawa who will do it. He can no longer do the work on the boards all himself. Find on in Pah who will come to Feyi-pn na Shep hebinasawa. It may take time, but Pah has thousands of people and one of them will want to come."

These were the words Han said, but Tug grapped an entirely different message. Han knew about her plan, had known all along, and now she was sending Tug away to carry it out.

Tug did not ask how she and the new apprentice would get back to the village.

She began preparing for her departure at once. Han helped her to set aside supplies for the journey, and after. She mended holes in her clothes, and went to Tano to find out from him what he needed in an apprentice. She spoke to the four people in Feyi-pn na Shep hebinasawa who had been to Pah before to get their advice about navigating and conducting herself there. And she told her parents she would be leaving.

The moment felt like a grim reflection of the time two years before where Durk and Jun went off to Pah. This was different though, because Tug could grap, could exist in their society as a normal member of it. And because she had been given a task to fulfill by Han, and had never before shown any interest in the lands beyond Issa. Tug's connection to her village, to her community, was strong. Though she could feel that her parents were sad to see her go, they were also proud, and confident in her return.

On the evening before the wood trader was due to arrive, everyone in Feyi-pn na Shep hebinasawa gathered around a fire in the center of the village to eat together and talk. They did this every night, but that night had an air of anticipation of something special. It wasn't often the village sent away one of their own young ones.

Tug sat on the ground with her parents, as always. Clouds obscured the never-rising-star, and for a few short hours that night the sun was below the horizon as well. Everything was lit by the glow of the fire. Tug could grap its flames and the shadows they cast, as well as feeling its warmth and hearing its crackling roar.

Her hands, ungloved, were wrapped around a warm cup of savoury broth. All around her, people laughed and chatted. Her parents were close to each other, affectionate. Tug felt sad and frightened.

Han came over with a bowl of dried salted tiny fish. She sat by Tug and said nothing. But her presence was reassuring.

Then Tug grapped a gentle nudge from Han. She was directing her attention away from the fire and the people and into the earth. Tug grapped the circles that had been carved from the ice for the houses in the village, and then deeper, into the stores. Her mind traced the shape of the carving that was deep underground; half memory, half grapping.

"Remember it," said Han. "It means something."

Tug murmured assent.

Right on her peripherals, just out of reach, Tug could grap that the carving went deeper, was connected to something more. Something bigger.

Two young children had stood up, preparing to entertain their families. They began to sing in clear sweet voices, the original tale of how all had come to be in the world. The story told how their two great stars had been alone in the universe, circling each other, and always at odds. The children made skillful, careful, motions with their arms that the audience could grap, to illustrate the story. The two stars settled their differences for just long enough to bring the planet Ia into existence. But soon they were fighting for her as well. Ia could not bear her parents' bickering, but nothing she tried would bring them peace. So she stopped trying. Ia was an icy giant, at equal distance between the two stars. The children, between them, brandished a snowball the size of their heads, for Ia.

In that moment, Tug felt lonely as Ia had, torn between two things she loved.

To stave off the loneliness, Ia wanted to make her own family. To do so, she had to make a choice. Ia went closer to one star, the gentler, the sun, fearing the brightness and intensity of the other would be too much for the children she would birth. The warmth of the sun melted some of Ia's ice. A great glacier slid away into rivers and underneath were the Issans. Ia's children, Tug's ancestors.

The song was followed by a respectful silence, then a round of applause and congratulations.

The next song in the sequence told of the first Issans' discovery of their world and how Ia worked with them to build their lives, despite the jealous efforts of the two stars.

But Tug did not stick around to hear it. She bade goodnight to her parents and Han, and walked into the blackness away from the fire, towards her home. The round house she shared with her parents, like all others in the village, was made from blocks of snow, and set deep into the ground. She moved aside the heavy hanging fraleaf curtain that covered the entrance and walked down the sloped entrance way. They shared one room, and the three of them slept on a raised shelf at the back of the room which was covered in blankets of woven fraleaf. Tug curled up in the back right corner, while her parents typically spread out over on the left side. There was plenty of room for Durk to take up his place, when he came back.

When she brought him back.

Tug slept soundly, but the knowledge, or feeling, or just her grap sense of the underground carving stayed with her through the night, followed her through unremembered dreams. When she woke, it was still pressing on her consciousness.

Her parents were already up, preparing breakfast probably. Not only Tug's departure, but the anticipated arrival of the wood trader was also a special occasion. Along with the wood came news from Pah, and sometimes, from other parts of the world. That was how they had heard about Durk and Jun, though in her heart Tug had known long before the news reached Feyi-pn na Shep hebinasawa.

Tug was all ready to go, and strangely at peace with the idea, and felt at a loose end that morning. She tried to help people who were preparing the center of the village for guests, but they shooed her away. She went to the kitchen but her father had plenty of assistants. People were coming and going from the stores, while Han sat at the door taking a mental note of everything that came in and went out. Han grapped her approach, and called out.

"Tug, join me, sit."

"I don't want to disturb you, Han.."

"I know, I know, just sit."

Tug sat, and watched people go by, and Han at work. She could grap the carving in the stores below them, but did not focus on it.

Everyone in the village sensed the approach of the wood trader. A sled came through the pass, pulled by a dozen drifthounds. The whole village came to meet them, arriving with blankets and food for both the trader and the dogs. The trader spoke in a soft, crackling voice once the layers of scarves and snow were removed from around her face. Tug was in the crowd, but neither attending nor listening to the conversation. She followed them to the village circle, and took her place as steaming fish soup and dark frabread was passed around. The trader was gone, for some moments, to dry and change, and then back, the center of attention again.

Nobody was unloading the wood from the sled. That could wait.

Once the trader had eaten and warmed up, Han took Tug over to introduce them. The trader's name was Amalq, and she was from the east of their land. Tug grapped that she was much shorter than most of the adults in the village, with a smaller build. Tug felt like a giant beside her. They sat, and Amalq listened as Han explained the situation.

"You are most welcome to travel back to Pah with me," said the woman hoarsely. "But the journey is long. Have you done this before?"

"No," said Tug.

"It took me a full cycle of the moon to get here. But most of the way was steep, and the dogs were slow with their load. The return will be half, because fraleaf weighs nothing close to wood. With two of us, we can be faster still."

"How so?"

"One of us can sleep while the other drives. There is no reason to stop, except to rest the dogs. They are made for this, and do not need much rest."

"I.. I don't know how to drive the drifthounds." Tug confessed.

"You will quickly learn," said Amalq with a smile. "We can take it easy for a few days until you get used to it."

"Amalq, you are generous and wise." Said Han in thanks. "I will leave you two now to discuss the details." She touched both of their shoulders in parting.

"It is your first time leaving your home," said Amalq. It wasn't a question. "But there is something more for you in Pah than a wood carver's apprentice. Will you tell me?"

"Perhaps," said Tug. "When we have begun our journey."

Amalq slapped her on the back and sipped from her cup. "I have made this journey, or ones like it, times beyond counting. All kinds of passengers I've had. Young and old, businesspeople and runaways."

"I've never seen you in Feyi-pn na Shep hebinasawa before." Said Tug.

"I haven't been here since before you were born, I expect," Amalq replied. "But every valley in the west has a village like yours. They all need wood. From some I trade for feathers or fish, from some shells or obsidian. Others have fraleaf too, of one kind or another. And everyone in Pah wants fraleaf, it isn't grown down by the sea, can't be found."

"By the sea," murmured Tug.

"Ah, the sea you're after is it?" Amalq had a cunning laughter in her voice. "Now the sea, I have never dealt with. But in Pah you will find plenty who have."

"Do you miss your home?" Asked Tug.

"Well now, I have many homes and none." Sensing Tug's puzzlement, Amalq elaborated. "The place I was born, in the west, no longer exists. Swallowed by the ice. But I spent only my childhood there, and those memories are foggy to me. I spent some time in Shupp, during my age of trying things, and tried many things. Shupp is bigger than Pah, many more kinds of people are there."

"Do you go back there? To Shupp?"

"It was a great challenge to come east across the ice. I tried and failed more than once. When I was young and reckless. Well, not so young, older than you and perhaps even your parents. But younger than I am now! I don't think I can do it again."

"Why... Why did you leave?"

"As Pah has villages in valleys, Shupp has them in mountains. I lived in one such for many years. We called it Feyy-pn na Sonow lusop Shuppwa. I had two tiny babies, many drifthounds, half wild they were, and people I loved all around me. The mountains are not to be trusted. One day I was foraging, and there was a great shaking all around. I had to wait for two days in a cave. When I returned, my village was gone, and everyone in it."

Tug was lost for words. "I..."

"There is nothing to be said if it now," the smile was still in Amalq's voice. "It was a long time ago. Lifetimes ago. Sometimes I wonder if Pah is my home, but I try not to think too much of it, lest it get swallowed by the sea!" It was a joke, but Tug did not laugh. "The ice is my home. The sled is my home. My dogs are my village. I spend more time there than anywhere else. You are welcome into my home, Tug!"

"Thank you," said Tug quietly. "You are generous and wise."

Others had unloaded the wood from Amalq's sled, and loaded it up with bundles of fraleaf. Most was just cleaned and processed and lay in flat strips, but some were bundles of things already made like clothes and mats. The sled itself was a smooth, curvy, hollow wooden structure. Tug could grap its streamlined lightness. Front and center, four seats were carved directly into its bulk, in a grid of two by two. Over these, a tent could be fastened, covering them completely for sleeping or shelter from a storm, or open at the front so they could use it while they were moving. But for now, the tent was put away altogether. Grooves were carved into the long back portion so that goods could be nestled in more securely. The bundles were then tied with rope over the top. There was no need to cover the fraleaf to keep it dry, as the material used to do this would have been fraleaf.

The drifthounds were harnessed to different parts of the sled. Some hauled from the side, but most were out in front. There was no mechanism to hold onto or pull on their reigns. They responded to Amalq's voice to a fault. They were all siblings from different litters, and their mother was old and lived by a warm fire with Amalq's friend in Pah. She introduced them one by one to Tug. Each was named after some type of storm.

"It will take them a few days to know you," said Amalq. "But they catch on pretty quick. You must learn to speak louder though." Amalq called out "SIT" and the dogs, who had been meandering around all over the place, sniffing things or scratching at snow, planted their behinds onto the ground as one. Each turned its head to look keenly at Amalq. "Tell them 'come'," she whispered to Tug.

"Come," said Tug timidly. The dogs hardly twitched. "COME," she tried again. Some whimpered, but none moved. 

"COME" bellowed Amalq, and all twelve of them trotted over. Some sat, some padded around, in a cluster by their feet. "It will take them a few days," Amalq said again. "We will start by commanding them at the same time. Then they will learn your voice with mine."

"Okay," said Tug, unconvinced. But what choice did she have?

They ate a fast meal, earlier than was typical, joined by Tug's parents, Han, and Han's partner Albe.

Suddenly, they were leaving. Tug took her place behind Amalq in the sled after they had hitched up all of the drifthounds. Amalq cried "AWAY" and Feyi-pn na Shep hebinasawa disappeared in a flurry of snow.

The only thing Tug had brought with her, which wasn't an essential like spare socks - the only thing she really had of her own, in fact - was a seashell Durk had given her. He visited home once after he had left for Pah, and brought it from the port. What he found was two shells, locked together. They seemed stuck, immovable, unless you twisted them in just the right way, and then they dropped apart. They were beautiful, he had told her, and she agreed, touching the spirally smooth shapes and grapping the essence of home for the small creatures once within, and their resilience after long journeys undertaken. That wasn't what he meant though. He tried to explain the colours, the reflection of light, patterns she could not feel or grap. It didn't matter though. Together they had bored a small hole in each and threaded them onto two thin ropes of fraleaf. Durk left with one shell hanging around his neck, and Tug had tucked the other away safe in the house. It wasn't practical to wear every day.

But she wore it now, under layers of tunics and coats and scarves.

For the first few days they stopped twice per day; once to eat and once to relieve themselves and stretch their legs. They slept at night, since Tug was not yet able to control the dogs, though only for a few hours. Nights, which was when the temperature dropped and the presence of the sun could not be felt, were becoming shorter as the summer approached in any case. 

Amalq told Tug stories of different villages she had visited, all over Issa, and Tug said little.

When they slept, they pitched two tents: one for the dogs on the ground, and one over the seats of the sled. Two or three dogs, depending on their mood, could squeeze into the sled tent and curl up with the two of them. Tug grew to love the smell of the coarse fuzzy fur next to her face, not to mention the warmth they provided.

One of the drifthounds became quickly attached to her. She was one of the youngest and strongest, a pup named Derecho. She would wake Tug up in the mornings with a sticky, rough kiss, and take food directly from Tug's hand.

"She's never taken to anyone like that before," commented Amalq. Derecho and her three siblings had been part of Amalq's crew for a little over a year.

"Neither have I," murmured Tug.

After about five sleeps after their journey began, Tug woke up with tears streaming down her face. She had dreamt about Durk and Jun and jagged icy caves and cold that went deep into her bones. She forgot where she was and thrashed out. Derecho was there, an enormous soothing presence who simply rolled closer in response. The hound licked the salty tears from Tug's face even as they were still flowing. She tried to repress the sobs that were shaking her body, spluttered as they got in the way of her breath.

"There now," Amalq was up and by her side. "Let it out."

So Tug bawled with the small woman pressed against one side of her, and the large dog on the other. Gradually their touch and grap calmed her. Amalq mopped her face with a scrap of fraleaf cloth. 

"Sorry," sniffled Tug.

"Don't be," said Amalq. "I was beginning to worry you had no feelings in you." She paused. "But I knew that wasn't true. Perhaps you'll tell me what you're running from, or to, today."

She left the tent to give Tug a few minutes of peace. Tug pulled her knees against her chest and pressed her face into them. Cyclone was also awake and edging closer, though not as ready to show affection as Derecho. Tug wanted to stay there forever, between the warm silent creatures. Her breathing finally steadied and she began to face the idea of the outside world again.

All they had seen was snow so far. Snow drifts, snow flurries, snow banks, slopes of snow that they coasted down, and mounds of snow that the dogs hauled them up. They were still in the *Shep*, the valley, and would be until maybe tomorrow. Then it would be time to summit a great ridge, Amalq told her, where on some parts the snow gave way to rock. This would slow them down, and the dogs would need more help. Today Tug needed to guide the sled herself.

TODO

"We should be able to grap Pah soon," said Amalq on the morning of the eleventh day. "Then we will reach it, if we go through the night tonight, early tomorrow morning."

Tug was happy to get there sooner, but the nights were so cold.

"Won't the dogs need a rest?"

"They know they're nearly home, they grap it too. They'll do this last stretch. Try to stop them! What awaits is warmth and fires and better food than they're getting out here."

Their pace slowed as the amount of trees they encountered increased. The broad trunks were still spaced plenty far enough apart for the dogs to guide the sled through, but every so often the sled would snag on a raised root or they'd have to skirt around a fallen branch.

This was an entirely new sensation for Tug. Other than the glacier, she had never grapped something looming over her head before. The only plants she knew were fraleaf and moss, and they both grew close to the ground, trailing through the snow.

They stopped around midday to eat mosscakes and dried fish. There was an atmosphere the forest lent that made it so different from being still when the landscape was only snow. There were sounds of bustling and shuffling, like things were alive. A light wind dislodged needles and pine cones, sending them spinning to the ground. Always something was moving around them, and Tug could grap it constantly, like tiny pinpricks all over her body.

"Pah is there, do you grap it?" Asked Amalq.

Tug sought around and found something beyond the trees. Inside the ground, deep and far away still, was more life. Layers of warrens that led out to empty space, and beyond that, the sea of liquid ice.

They continued on. The dogs were more excitable and seemed to have an extra burst of energy. Night drew in and they paused to put up the sled tent, but then carried on. In their seats they bundled themselves with blankets and pressed close to each other to keep out the cold. Tug was too excited to fall asleep, but Amalq's head dropped to the side from time to time.

As the touch of the sun slowly, gently, made itself known once more, Tug grapped the city. They were on top of it! So many people in one place! And the ocean stretched out before them, endless.

The approach to Pah by land rendered the city invisible to a non-Issan, as it was built into the face of a sheer, curving cliff that made almost a full semi-circle of the bay. Sleds approached over the top of the cliff, with a view out towards the ocean and only a steep drop being apparent. But to those who knew the route, a gentle incline lead down the side of the cliff and zigzagged across until it joined the lines of streets that switched back and forth between the homes and businesses of Pah. One large such street, smooth and unstepped, was reserved for inbound sleds, and the rest were for walking on.

From the sea, which is how most non-Issans approached Pah, it was a far more incredible sight. The flat land at the base of the cliff was little, and hosted infrastructure needed for ship building, loading and unloading, and feeding and entertaining inbound sailors or fisherfolk. Most foreigners never got past this strip. It was almost impossible to navigate Pah without being able to grap its complexities. The city proper was all vertical, with the cliff face peppered with round structures like birds nests, with entry holes in the centers. Some of these led to a mass of tunnels with markets and workshops, places to eat, or sleep, or for the sick to be taken care of. Some of them were shallow, just rooms carved into the rock, home to one or two families, or just used for storage.

Issans of course could grap this cliff face from any direction, as a tower of life and activity.

As the sled descended down the shallow slope, diligently guided by the drifthounds who had done this a hundred times, Tug abandoned her duties at the reigns. It was early, but nonetheless people were waking up inside the ground. Someone hailed them from a smaller street up ahead and just above them.

"Amalq, is that you?"

"Tess! How are you this fine morning?"

"I see you have an extra load!" The man approached and joined the side street that ran alongside, just above, the wide one and jogged slightly to keep up with the sled.

"This here is Tug, here to seek an apprentice wood carver for Feyi-pn na Shep hebinasawa."

"Hello," said Tug.

"Welcome," said Tess. "I shall set the word out at once. I'll catch up with you when you have unloaded?"

"Certainly," said Amalq, and Tess was gone. "Tess is a native of Pah," said Amalq. "He knows everyone and everyone knows him. And he has a thousand siblings I'm sure. To run into him so quickly was a stroke of luck, but then again, he does seem to be everywhere at once."

"Amalq," said Tug uneasily. 

"What's the matter?"

"Where should I go?"

## Jackann (doesn't want to leave)

Jackann was suspicious from the moment their father had announced a change in his usual schedule. He hadn't asked about the contents of the letter, but Professor Emery's countenance had definitely changed when he emerged from reading it. Now they were sitting in the corner of the tiny tea house down the road from Lark's school. The sun was just up, but hidden behind thick clouds, as white as the Sea that covered the Chasm. Their corner was dark, therefore, but warmed by the dented metal tea pot that was almost the same size as the round table they occupied.

Their father had poured steaming cups for each of them. Lark leaned forwards to slurp from the edge of his without lifting it, and yelped as he burnt his tongue. Jackann inhaled the steam, the warm, earthy scent soothing his exhausted mind and making his eyelids droop.

The Professor blew gently across the top of his cup, holding it up to his face with a finger and thumb of both hands, and took a sip. He sighed.

"This is your mother's favourite, you know," he told them. "I've been meaning to send her a packet. There's not much chance she'll be able to get hold of it in the mountains."

"Is that why we're here?" Asked Jackann. "Was the letter about mother?"

The Professor shook his head. "The letter was about me. About us. There's something I need to talk with you both about."

Jackann waited in silence for his father to gather his thoughts.

"Jack, I have to embark on an expedition. I want you both to come."

"For your research? Where abouts?" The Professor had been away to carry out experiments before. Jackann had accompanied him a few times, usually to open or less populous areas of the city, and once to the southern mountains where his mother worked. The last had been several years ago, when he was still enrolled in school, and keen for any excuse not to be there. Lark had been a babe in arms, but travelled well nonetheless.

"Further than before. Out... out east."

"East? To the Sourcelands? How far?"

"As far is it takes. There's much to discover out there, of great importance. You and Lark will be part of the pioneering team. We'll find the truth, and open up a whole new world, a new era for Tantonians."

"What? Why? Lark's only a baby, how can that make sense? The Sourcelands! It's not safe!"

"That's the point, son, it is safe. That's where my research has lead. I'm confident that it's not what everyone thinks, out there."

"You can't take Lark. What if you're wrong? Nobody comes back from there! We've all seen the pictures of the ruins, the desolation!"

"Pictures can lie. Pictures can be changed or faked. That's what I need to find out for sure. What is really going on. You must understand, I have to stop the lies from spreading. There's something happening in the Sourcelands. Come with me and find out what. We'll make history."

"No, that's ridiculous. I'm staying here, and so is Lark."

The Professor gave an exasperated sigh, and stared into his cup as he swirled the remains of his tea. Jackann's cup had stopped steaming, but he hadn't taken a sip.

"That's up to you, Jackann, if you want to stay. And it's up to Lark, too."

"Lark," Jackann interjected at once. "There's nothing in the Sourcelands. It's cold and stormy and there are no other people. You don't surely want to go?"

"I do," said Lark quietly. "I want an adventure."

Jackann glared at their father. "You've already talked to him about this. You've already convinced him. That's not fair. He believes you because you're his father. How can you think it's okay to lie to him? He doesn't know, he's too young."

"I'm NOT too young!" Lark slammed the table, but his little hands didn't make much of an impact. "I saw Prof's experiments. I know it's for the good of the whole world if we go out there. I want to see, I want to see the monsters and the mountains and the science. I'm going!"

Jackann was aghast. "You spent yesterday convincing him? Brainwashing him? Lark, what about your friends at school? What about... " For a moment, Jackann felt as bad as his father. "What about if mother comes back?"

"Six months, she said. It won't be sooner than that, it's always longer. We'll come back when she comes back. Besides, I can't go to school, so that doesn't make any difference." He crossed his tiny arms in defiance.

"She... what do you mean you can't go to school?" Jackann looked from his brother to his father.

The Professor shook his head. "There's no more money, Jackann, we lost the right. This is why we have to go. This city doesn't want us, can't keep us."

"What? How?"

"What you're earning has kept us alive, kept us eating. But my title has been taken. Nothing else your mother can send. The city will no longer employ me, and our time has run out. No-one in Tanton wants what I have to offer. Not without proof. Evidence I can only get in person, there's no-one left to trust with this. There's enough left to buy supplies and passage for us toward the Sourcelands. That is why it is time to go."

Jackann opened and closed his mouth. How could his father have deceived him so? How could he not have noticed, not have suspected? Had he really been so self absorbed?

"I'm sorry, son. I realise... I know I have..." The Professor paused, then said finally. "Will you come?"

Jackann's mouth was still open. He scraped his stool back, and stood, slowly shaking his head, seething. "I can't just up and leave. Why would you think it's that simple? I'm not a six year old you can just carry about wherever you see fit. I still work, I have a right to a place in this city. Make Lark my dependent, he can go to school by my rights! Into the Sourcelands of all places." Everything he'd ever heard, everything been taught all his life about the dangers of that place, and his father wanted to move there? Wanted to take Lark?

"I've tried to teach you, Jack. I've told you about my research! I've told you not to believe what the inner-circle 'scientists' say."

"Not about this, not about what's out there! How can you expect me to just... You said the Source was safe, not the Sourcelands! I believed you, I thought it made sense. I used Source power without a second thought, I've argued with my friends about using too much. But the Sourcelands? They're a waste. They are a waste?" 

The Professor nodded.

"Then how can they be safe? Tanton City is this far west for a reason. No-one comes back from out there, no-one. Do they? Will you?"

"No-one has been out there for more than fifty years. There have been no expeditions, no investigations. Nobody remains who is willing and able to testify about the Sourcelands based on real experience. I am certain that... I can't say here, but I have experiments ready, and I am confident in my theories. The horror stories... they're spread for a reason, Jack. They're spread to stop people going out there."

"No, how can that be? Who would? What could there possibly be? This is a ridiculous conspiracy theory, exactly what you say about what they say about the Source!" Jackann spluttered, waving his hands in a vain effort to express how contradictory everything was that his father was telling him. "And you're going to drag Lark into the middle of this. This madness! It's not fair! Everyone knows it's a wasteland, it's dead, nothing lives. How will you live? Whether the Source killed everything or something else did, it doesn't matter, it's all dead."

"I want to see the monsters," Lark interjected.

"There are no monsters," said Emery, at the same time Jackann said, "monsters will eat you, Lark."

It was Emery's turn to glare at his son. "Monsters or not, it's not a safe place to take a kid. There's no civilisation, nobody to help you if something happens."

Emery looked sad. "There's none of that here, either, son. Nobody wants to hear what I have to say, and nobody would so much as turn their head if I keeled over on the street. Not if I'm not employed, and I'm not."

"What... what about the house? Professor, you can still use the house?"

Professor Emery shook his head. "Not for much longer."

"How much longer?"

"We leave tomorrow evening."

"So then what?"

"Come with us Jackann, please."

"That's not fair. That's not fair! You're not... I can't! I have a job, friends. I have... I can't just leave. Why couldn't you have said this sooner? How long have you been planning this? Why would you tell me there is one day left? That's not fair!" Jackann was backing away from the table. He couldn't just leave, he couldn't. Not to go to the Sourcelands.

"Jack, I know, I understand. I thought there was more time, I did. But things caught up. Things changed faster than I expected. Jack, come with us. You have time to think about it. Just calm down, I know you'll make the right decision. Jack..."

Jackann looked at his father and his brother. Suddenly they were strangers both, trying to tear him from his home, upending his whole life with barely a moment's notice. He was dreaming, how could they be leaving? Nobody came back from the Sourcelands, nobody. He trusted the Professor, he knew he was smart, and he knew how doggedly his research was challenged by the scientific institutions who could afford to drive him away, to call him crazy. He knew to distrust the rulers of Tanton City, knew his father had fled the corruption of those on the payroll of the politicians. Or so he thought. Without realising it, Jackann had backed all the way out of the door of the tea house, and was stumbling down the gravel slope of the hill called Jarta. He didn't know where he was going, but his instinct was to hide. To hide and think. To pry the conspiracies apart, and figure out if it had been his father who had been crazy all along.

... TODO [j thinks about going to his mother. he should at least write to her]

At the top he almost collided with his boss, who flapped his arms to shoo him back down.

"There's enough of you lot up there, you won't fit, you won't fit. You're on deliveries," he growled.

Jackann groaned.

"That's what you get for being late then, isn't it?"

"I wasn't... well, whatever."

Back out in the yard, Jackann found a packed rucksack waiting for him. The bag was standing on the ground, and passed his waist when he stood beside it. He bent to heave it onto his shoulders, and was surprised to find the boss helping to push it up from below.

"Too many of you lot all of a sudden," he was grumbling. "I can't afford the lot of you. Could get everything done with half if I made you work twice as hard. Some of you are gonna have to go. What do you think? Do you make the cut?"

Jackann played it cool. "I should think so sir, I'm the best you've got. Only Toqann can stamp faster than me, and there's not many of us who have all the codes memorised. No-one gets along with the birds like I do, either." He didn't know if that was true, but he suspected that his boss didn't either. The hairy man made an indecipherable noise, and stomped back into his hut. Jackann suspected he had been expecting flustered pleading for the job they both knew he needed, but was confident that displeasing him on that front would not cost him his employment.

He scanned the list of deliveries to be made, trusting in his co-workers to have packed the rucksack in a sensible order. There were a fixed number of usual routes around the city, all of which he knew like the back of his hand. The heading at the top of the sheet read 'BACK TRACK II w DVRSN'. Half way down the list an arrow had been drawn between two entries, and the diversion added was '2-o-54 Brightone Street [heavy!!]'. So that's what was causing his shoulders to ache already. Back Track II was the second longest route, after the original Back Track, though the predecessor was very rarely required these days. Both of them described winding paths around lesser visited parts of Tanton City's outer edges, and the detour to Brightone Street was part of the original route, further to the east than Back Track II ordinarily went. The route for these deliveries formed a wiggly semi-circle around over half of the city, and there was no way it would still be light when he finished. The mail office was about as far west as sensible people usually cared to venture; he could cut through just south of the city centre, more or less, before heading north and east to Brightone Street, then back round again to where he started. The Tantonian capital wasn't huge, and looking at the trail on a map it wouldn't seem too far for one afternoon's work. But it wasn't that simple of course. Tanton City was not flat. Quite the contrary. The second biggest hill (after that of the mail office) was in the centre of the city, topped with an ancient fort that, now vastly extended and modernised, housed the parliamentary offices of the various governing bodies of Tanton and its colonies. The hill was not particularly steep, and sprawling gardens covered its sides, coasting gradually down to the city proper. The inner ring contained neighbourhoods of well maintained residences of politicians and important members of things like merchants guilds and scientific movements, as well as shopping outlets that sold things normal people weren't usually interested in; unnecessary luxuries, and obscure scientific instruments.

The mail office where Jackann worked was not usually called upon to make deliveries in these areas. These people used specialist couriers, or their own staff and birds to collect and send packages. Jackann's route across town to Brightone Street skirted just south of there, past the Ivory Quartermile neighbourhood that sat in an artificially carved rectangular valley, and up, down and around the various mounds that were stacked haphazardly with low, chalky white buildings.

Jackann hauled the sack onto his back and began the walk. For some segments he could hop on one of the one-car trams running into or out of the city center. It was routine, apart from the detour. It was a clear day. The Source was directly overhead, and the sun a little below it. At this time of year the Source was almost the same size as the sun, and it seemed as though they were competing. They were, according to *very* old myths from before even the Empire was around. The competition meant, at least, that most of Tantonia never got particularly cold. But the sky was white and the Sourcelight filtering through the atmosphere gave everything a colder hue.

Nonetheless, Jackann was sweating by the time he got to the top of the hill and located Brightone Street. The houses here were fairly new, but built in the old domed styles. They all had weird oddities though. One had an additional roof dome, on top of the normal one, made entirely from glass. Another supported a series of long rods, poking out from all angles like a pincushion. A third was covered entirely in dark green leaves, of a vined plant that had been coaxed to grow all over it.

The house Jackann had a package for had rectangular windows, rather than the traditional ovals or circles, and they were much bigger. Only they had tinted panes so nobody could see inside. It was set back in not insignificant, albeit unkempt, grounds. Jackann had to walk down an overgrow, weed-lined stone path to reach a door. There was no box for the mail, and nowhere obvious to leave it.

But the door had a brass knocker. He used it.

Almost immediately a loud crash sounded inside the house. As if Jackann had startled someone carrying a tray of metal spoons. There were muffled voices; Jackann was sure he could hear two distinct ones. He pulled the box out of his backpack, and waited patiently. He tried to resist the urge to shake it, but it rattled a little when it was moved.

He heard footsteps coming towards the front door, and then an inhuman cry that made his blood run cold. It was somewhere between a scream and a howl, and followed by more crashing and clamouring.

The door opened a crack, and he saw the narrow eyes of a bald man half a head shorter than himself. Jackann held out the package.

"Excellent, thank you." The man said, reaching both arms out to take it. The door opened just wide enough for Jackann to see chaos strewn across the floor, and some kind of brown muddy mess, and then shut sharply in his face.

He wondered if he should knock again to check if everything was okay, and pondered on this as he backed down the path.

Then the scream-howl came again, this time not softened by the walls of the house. Something burst forth from an upstairs window on one side, and soared into the sky. Silhouetted against the rich blue of impending dusk, Jackann could not believe what he saw. An enormous bird was spiralling upwards. It had huge, wide wings with distinctly round-tipped feathers. It's tail was forked and its beak was long and hooked, and at least the size of a person's forearm. It's head was crested with two distinct curved bunches of feathers that looked like horns. There was nothing with that profile in the mail tower, or even in Tantonia. Jackann knew it was a bird from the other side of the Sourcelands, from the country of Tivnies. He had seen pictures, and one of their enormous feathers was displayed in a glass case on a wall in the City Hall. He knew nobody who had seen one in the flesh.

It was a lark, the creature for which his brother was named.

Why would one come to Tanton City? These were birds of the mountains.

Not only that, but technically Tantonia had been at war with Tivnies since the end of the Last Balan War. The War had resolved the differences between most of the nations of the Balan continent, namely by dissolving the Tantonian Empire and restoring independence to a whole lot of them, but Tivnies had never been a part of all that. Not on the record, anyway. It was widely understood that Tivnies had let the United Front of East Balan launch an invasion by sea from their shores so that they could reach the Empire's north shore without crossing the Sourcelands. Not that anybody had ever proved that. And there was no fighting these days, of course, but now they contested Tantonia's claim on the Sert Isles and had been in a standoff there for longer than Jackann had been alive.

Mysterious, exotic, far away places that Jackann could never expect to see. All he knew was, hammered to him and others his age since childhood: Tivnies were the enemy. People from Tivnies were not to be trusted. The last generation involved in the Last Balan War were long gone, but the rhetoric remained.

And Jackann also knew that the function of birds was communication. Birds in cities, at least. So that meant that whoever was in this house was in communication with Tivnies. And it didn't seem right to be in communication with Tivnies.

He should probably mind his own business.

The lark disappeared into a speck and was gone.

"Ah, you're still here, good." The front door of the house had opened again. Jackann was only half way down the garden path. "I know it's terribly rude of me to bypass the system and all that, but I have a local delivery?" The short man produced a letter. "But it's so hard for me to get about and perhaps you're going that way anyway, or one of your colleagues perhaps?"

Jackann walked toward him automatically and put out his hand.

Had he just imagined the lark bursting out of the side of the house? Why was this man acting so normally?

"It's all addressed you'll see, everything should be in order? And here's something for your trouble." The man pressed the letter and silver coin into Jackann's palm. "Thank you kindly, young man." And the door was closed again.

The coin was a *waclet*, round, with a hole in the center for threading onto string. It was enough to feed Jackann for a month. More than enough to buy his silence.

Today was shaping up pretty well after all. Jackann wandered down the hill, gazing up at the sky, and enjoying the colours of a simultaneous sunset and Source-rise, almost able to put out of his mind for a few moments the fact that his family were preparing to leave him in favour of certain danger. Maybe this money would be enough to convince the Professor to say for just a little longer. Some clouds were gathering; dark to the west on a purple-orange backdrop, and orange in the east, reflecting the sun's light against the inky black of coming night. The Source glowed blue, just above the horizon, and he lost sight of it as he reached the bottom of the hill.

Jackann continued on his route to deliver the rest of his letters. He had saved everything for the city center and the old town until after he had unburdened himself of the heavy parcel. He held the new letter close to his face to read the address in the low light, then almost dropped it in surprise.

It was addressed to his father.

TODO [j sits on the letter and doesn't give it to the prof. the prof and lark leave, maybe while j isn't there. j moves into a shared house while he works up a plan. the letter directs the prof to come to lonton en route to the sourcelands to collect something]

## Jackann (sets off)

There were two hundred and thirty two steps to the top of the bird tower. There was also a Source-powered lift, but when Jackann wasn't hauling a bag of mail he liked to take the stairs, and let his mind wander. About three quarters of the way up, the exertion got the better of the wandering, and by the time he reached the top he was usually feeling satisfyingly blank.

Tonight, though, there was too much to consider. He needed to make a plan.

In Jackann's back pocket was another letter to Suari, his final one. He had poured his heart out, his hopes and fears. He couldn't know it was already too late for her to ever receive it. Word of unrest across the White Sea would not reach Tanton City for at least another few days.

The Source was rising, casting its eerie hue across the clouds of the Sea, turning them a ghostly blue. Jackann had made his walk through the city in the dark of full night, and would return in the same way, spending the hours of Sourcelight in the tower. He wasn't hiding from anyone in particular, but the darkness was a comfort, and fewer people were out and about.

The bird tower was Jackann's favourite place in the whole city. He wasn't alone, of course. Every single youth who worked for the postal service, or ever had, along with their siblings, friends, and cousins, would declare the same. It was the highest point in Tanton City, so the view, day or night in either direction, was unparalleled. The city sloped up towards the Sea, and the tower had been built on the highest point of the cliff, almsot teetering on the edge of the sheer drop to the White.

Any number of rebellious young people could be found up the tower out of hours. It was big, but not huge, and the odds of bumping into someone else in everyone's favourite 'secret' place was pretty high. It was commonly understood that people went there for solitude or tranquility though, and by unspoken agreement late night visitors maintained silence, avoided eye contact, and never spoke of meeting in the tower when the Sun was up. Jackann knew that even if he was seen, he would not be *seen*.

Most came to look out on the city. The east side of the tower let one gaze out across the heart of Tanton. The low, wide white houses with roof gardens and open grounds and even pools or springs for bathing, of the most wealthy citizens made up the immediate surroundings. Though none of the old Tantonian royal families had ever lived full time in Tanton City, several hundred years ago one of them had built a palace there nonetheless. Of course, on the hillside, where the Emperor could look down on his subjects, should he deign to visit. The complex was visible a little to the north of the tower, a maze of white walls and curving buildings with balconies and wings and stubby (compared to the bird tower) turrets with carved steps winding around the outsides. Since Tanton City became the capital of Tantonia after the end of the Last Balan War, the little used palace had been taken over for the parliament building, which is all Jackann had ever known it as.

The lowest part of the valley was the old town, the really old town. It was cramped and poorly insulated and poorly supplied, but cheap to live there, which is why Jackann's family did. Every house was small and domed, with round windows and archways for doors. There were thousands of them, and apart from the single new tramline which ran diagonally from the northwest to the southeast, the dwellings were stuffed together with narrow twisty streets between them that could barely be seen from the height of the bird tower. From up there, they looked like a plague of pimples, uneven bumps, spreading from the base of the hill, bubbling through the valley floor, until the ground began to rise again for the rolling hills of the suburbs.

For normal people, not the super rich or uncomfortably poor, the suburbs were the most desirable place to live. The higher one climbed, the newer the buildings, as the city had no other direction in which it could expand. In the lower regions the architects had tried to mimic the style of the old town, only higher. Five or six storeys of round boil-houses were piled unevenly on top of each other, the porches that weren't on the ground forming balconies instead. In imitation of the old palace, some buildings had their stairs winding up the outside.

A few decades of this was enough though, and higher up the hill were simpler and more space efficient blocks, reaching up to eight storeys (measured from the ground - sometimes the hillside meant entry on the far side was several floors up). There, straight lines and corners were jarring if one's eyes mapped across the city from the bubbling old town to the new.

The hills were low, and thoroughly bristling with tower blocks. The streets were straighter, more even, and more often broken by tramlines here. An observer as high as the bird tower could see beyond the hills, to where the land became flat, sparsely occupied farmland. But any lower than that, and it was buildings as far as the eye can see.

The city view did not interest Jackann that night. He followed the narrow staircase to the very top floor (there were seven other places he could have stepped out, before then). The tower had a central core around which the stairs wound. On every floor this provided an enormous round room, variously designed for sorting and packaging. The upper eight floors had outer loops too, where the birds lived, and from where they could be released. The birds who flew the longest distances were at the very top.

Jackann's favourite almarant, who he had dubbed Blue after the Sourcelight, lived in an enclosure facing out over the White Sea. Smaller birds had mesh windows, but Blue was big enough to be trapped by bars. The creature was enormous; his wingspan greater than that of Jackann's arms and a body the size of a man's torso. Blue's feathers were not blue, but a cool grey which shone silver in the Source. Jackann enjoyed the contradiction.

Jackann entered Blue's roost, and closed the door behind him. He crossed the space in a few strides to the window. Blue was awake, but hardly stirred. His black eyes followed Jackann from where he nestled in a pile of straw.

Jackann pressed his forehead against the bars of the window and let his arms spill through and hang loose. Far below, the White Sea churned. He strained his eyes against the horizon, but even on a bright clear day Jackann could only imagine he saw any trace of life on the other side of the chasm. Not for the first time, he wondered how it could really be possible to fly further than the eye could see, even for a bird so large as Blue, and then return with treasures and words from the other side.

He shook his head and fished the letter from his pocket. It was already bound and appropriately weighted. Blue was a big bird for big deliveries. He could well forget he was carrying something as light as a single letter, and was well trained enough to turn right back around and come home. Jackann usually tagged his mail onto other shipments to Mntrnao of course. And Suari did the same with her returns. He would be fired for sure if anyone found out he sent Blue out off schedule and for his own purposes. Jackann didn't hesitate; he would be gone by morning.

Blue cooed dozily as Jackann walked over. He slapped a palm on either side of the bird's beak and rubbed up and down. Blue gurgled and his eyes flickered closed, enjoying the caress.

"Time to wake up I'm afraid buddy," Jackann murmured. "I need you to do me a favour."

Blue climbed willingly into his harness, which was made up of a multitude of straps and hooks and pockets so any kind of load could be attached. Jackann simply slipped the package into a pouch on Blue's front. It bulged against Blue's chest enough for him to notice something was there.

Jackann pressed his face into the feathers on the side of Blue's neck and took a deep breath. He tasted dust and straw and the comforting fresh scent of the sky. Blue shifted from one foot to the other. Not impatiently, just enough to let Jackann know he was ready to go.

"Okay then. This is it I guess."

Jackann led Blue to the window, unhooked five latches along the side and slid open bolts from the ceiling and the floor. Half of the wall swung outwards and Jackann stepped deftly aside as Blue lurched forward without any further prompting. His wings spread as soon as he was clear of the opening, Blue arced down, almost (or so it seemed to Jackann) close enough to brush the clouds of the White Sea. He curved back up, soaring further away and higher than the tower itself. Jackann watched until Blue was a spec in the distance.

"Fly safe, old friend."

Jackann leaned forwards out of the opening to check the door was properly caught. It would remain open now until Blue's return. As he did it, his eyes caught an irregularity on the side of the tower below. It was dark still, but the silhouette of an open door against he swirling white below could not be mistaken. Jackann knew even without thinking about it that none of the birds on this side of the tower should be out. If someone else was sending out secret late night deliveries as well he should just leave them be, and yet... Jackann looked again. Three or four floors down he could make out a pair of legs, swinging back and forth from the opening.

Probably just some lost and lonely kid, checking out the view. But if the bird was still in there, it wasn't safe to sit like that. They were all well behaved, many even afraid to fly without a harness, but sometimes the open wall made them jumpy and even a medium sized almarant would have no trouble knocking a person over the edge if it decided to take flight. Jackann cringed, wary of disturbing someone's Sourcelight contemplations, but his gut said something was wrong.


Jackann recognised the back of Nika's head at once from the doorway. Her hair fell long down her back in loose ringlets, so different from most straight-haired natives of Tanton City. Nika's mother, who nobody had ever met, reportedly came from one of the southeastern lands, and had gifted Nika with an appearance that made her stand out, along with a name so long and foreign that everyone who knew her had to shorten it to something still unusual, but at least pronounceable. A tangalin was stalking back and forth, ruffling its feathers. Nika had never worked with the birds as far as Jackann knew. He had never seen her up here before, and clearly neither had the tangalin.

"What's up Nika?" Said Jackann, approaching slowly with his left hand out to coax the tangalin towards him. She didn't look around, but put her head in her hands, leaning forward slightly.

Jackann groped in his pocket and came out with a scrap of paper. He scrunched it and jerked his wrist toward the door to throw it. The bird darted towards where it landed.

Jackann, just as hastily, was on the ledge beside Nika, his hand firmly around her upper arm. He crouched beside her.

She turned her head just enough to make eye contact. Jackann could see her eyes swollen and red. Her whole face, a few shades darker than Jackann's, was blotchy. Her hair hung in front of her face. On impulse, Jackann gently lifted a lock away from her cheek. He dropped it and pulled his hand away sharply at the sight of a deep, mottled blue and red bruise reaching from her cheek to her left eye.

"What happened?"

"Life happened." She turned her face away from him. "What do you want?"

"It... it's not safe up here. Like this. The tangalin could knock you over. I saw you from... From above. That's all."

"It's not safe," she repeated, kicking her feet back and forth. Her shoes were loose, light slippers which were a strong breeze away from abandoning her feet fro the eddy below. "What are you doing here?"

Jackann hesitated. "Watching the Sea."

Nika snorted. "Sure you were. Did you send the almarant out?"

"Just, uh, it's work."

"You're a terrible liar. What package can't wait until morning?"

"I'm running away." Jackann snapped suddenly. "Want to come?"

Her eyes widened and she actually met his.

"Seriously?"

"Yeah." He didn't elaborate.

"Where are you- You know what? I don't care. Let's go."

Jackann hadn't really expected her to agree. He wanted to distract her from the bottomless drop that seemed to be calling. Probably they would get to the city limits and she would change her mind anyway. After all, *her* father and brothers were still here.

Jackann made sure the tangalin was safely back in its nest, and rather than leave Nika alone again dragged her up a level to retrieve his supplies, then they headed back down.

"Want to stop by home for anything on the way?"

"No." She snapped before he even finished the sentence.

"I only have enough food for me. And money."

"I can take care of myself."

They walked in silence for the most part. Few things moved in the city at this hour, and voices carried from the streets into the rooms of sleeping people with ease.

Jackann took them north, toward the outskirts of the city. The houses were further apart as workshops and factories took over. There were no lamps, but everything was well lit by natural Sourcelight.

"Wait there," said Nika suddenly. Before Jackann could object, she had darted down a side street. Jackann followed cautiously, but she was already out of sight. It only took him a minute to resolve to just carry on without her, but by then she was back, dropping from a high window in the side of an industrial building. Now she was wearing a backpack, and more robust shoes.

"Okay. Carry on."

Jackann decided not to ask.

They walked for another half an hour before Jackann noticed that Nika was limping.

"You're limping," he pointed out.

She shrugged.

"You're bleeding!" He had thought it was a shadow, but the Sourcelight caught her dress enough to reveal a patch of blood, expanding, below her right hip.

"Forget it," she growled. "I'm fine."

So sure did she seem that Jackann said no more of it.

They reached the Outer Ring Long Distance Tram Station in the early hours of the morning. 

"The tram to Lonton leaves just before sunrise." Jackann told Nika. She just nodded. They sat together by the tracks.

"Wake up," Nika jabbed Jackann in the ribs with her elbow. He jolted upright. "Our ride is here."

The sky was beginning to lighten. The Source had set and given way to warmer hues. A vehicle with five or six carriages stood on the track before them.

Jackann scrambled to his feet. They stepped through the nearest carriage door. The cars were lined along their inside edges with narrow uncomfortable metal benches. The layout was such that if all the seats were taken, passengers would be forced to stare across the aisle at each other rather than enjoy what view there was through the grimy windows.

But there was nobody else in the car with Jackann and Nika tonight. The tram set off at a slow trundle.

"How long does it take?" Nika asked.

Jackann suddenly realised she was still with him, leaving Tanton City, and had not hesitated for a moment when boarding the tram. She could have run off while he slept. She wasn't even looking back.

"A day," he said. "We will arrive at sunrise tomorrow."

"Great," Nika said. "I'll sleep for a while." She lay on the floor of the tram carriage, flat on her back, and closed her eyes.

Jackann remained on the bench. He hitched his knees up to his chin and leaned sideways against the wall, back to the direction they were travelling. He gazed out as the sun rose over Tanton City's nearest countryside.

They were disturbed mid-morning by the tram conductor. The small, beady-eyed woman stood at the end of the car and cleared her throat several times until Jackann and Nika woke up.

Jackann scrambled in his pack for the papers that proved he worked at the mail center. A job was all it took to earn the right to ride the trams. The conductor nodded curtly. 

"What about you?"

Nika was rooting through her backpack, but came up short.

"Oh gee- I work at Tenar's Arrangements, with flowers you know, but I don't have my papers."

"Address?"

Nika hesitated. "Mine, or?"

"Your job, your job," the conductor waved her hand impatiently.

"Fourth house on Selmey Row," she said. "It's a-"

"That'll do, that'll do." The conductor marched through, stepping around Nika to enter the next carriage.

"You really work with flowers?" Said Jackann.

"You really work at the mail center?" Nika shot back.

Jackann sighed. "Right up until they find Blue gone. Any minute now I guess."

"You're really not coming back to Tanton?"

"Maybe one day. You?"

Nika shrugged. "I hope not. I don't care." She paused. "Maybe I can get to CARS Balan."

The Co-operating Autonomous Regions of South Balan was less of a country and more of a wild collection of primitive anarchists, so far as Jackann knew. He thought Nika might fit in well there, but still asked "why?"

"Why not?" She growled.

"Is... is that where your mother is?"

"None of your business." And the subject was closed.

The tram trundled on. Jackann ate some crackers and berries. He didn't offer them to Nika, and nor did she ask.

As farmland rolled by, Jackann's mind wandered. He thought of Lark playing in the mud outside their house on morning after a night of heavy rain. The kid was covered from head to toe in grey sludge, and Jackann had had to take him to one of the larger founts of water to wash him off. Probably the puddles in the Sourcelands were toxic, and the rain toxic too. There would be nowhere for Lark to play. Anything he touched would be poison. The kid loved his stories, but the Professor was only going to be able to occupy him with those for so long. Lark needed to run around under the sky as well.

Jackann had taken a long distance tram once before, when the three of them  had travelled to visit his mother. That time they left at a more reasonable hour, and went south, along the coast of the White Sea. There was a small town there called Usbedge. It had been the thriving ancient historical center of the Tantonian Empire, before the Last Balan War. Now there was no Empire, and Usbedge had been mostly destroyed. It was rebuilt, but not fast enough and not big enough, and the heart of the country moved to Tanton City. That was a hundred years ago or more. 

The Professor had explained all this to Jackann and baby Lark when they stayed one night in the town on that journey south. They went to see some ruins of an old fort built into the cliffside, overhanging the White Sea, and the site of an epic battle.

Then they continued the journey in a trailer pulled by two men pedalling two enormous three-wheeled contraptions. They didn't have anything like that in Tanton City; the streets were too narrow. Jackann remembered watching in fascination as the drivers remained in perfect synchronisation. Maybe he could get one of those for himself in Lonton.

His mother worked at the foot of the Hennysynnia, the south most mountain range in Tantonia. Somewhere in those mountains was the border - patrolled and fortified since the War - with the lands of South West Balan. Crossings were tightly controlled to this day. It was part of the original conditions of armistice, which by then Tantonia had been in no position to refuse. Jackann would not be able to go south that way, if he wanted to, having no demonstrable connection with any of the southern countries. But citizens of any of the eight or nine independant states (the borders down there were still shifting and settling) were free to move north to Tantonia. Not many did. Many hundreds of thousands had been displaced from south of the Hennysynia during the centuries long existence of the Tantonian Empire. Their descendants made a great surge back towards their homelands when the Empire fell.

Jackann had always assumed Nika's ancestry came from there. But maybe she was even more alien than he thought.

"Nika, do you speak any other languages?" He broke the silence.

"No." She shrugged, and went back to the small pocket of freeze-dried fruit she had been picking at.

"Jackann murmured an acknowledgement and went back inside his head.

Why *did* his penpal write to him in Tantonian? There were many different languages even all around the continent of Balan. It made no sense that they would speak and write Tantonian on the other side of the White Sea. Unless the Empire used to spread further than Jackann had been taught. But she also drew those complicated square pictures in place of an address, and at the bottom of her letters under her name too. So that must be her main language. How interesting that they would learn Tantonian across the Sea but here, in the city at least, people hardly knew a thing about the sand-lands.

"Nika, what do you know about the sand-lands?"

"Mntrnao?"

"Uh. Yes."

"Stuff from school. Why?"

"Like what? Specifically?"

"Uhhh it's all a big desert. There's no water except for this one spring in the palace. It never rains. They all live like kings in the palace, the whole city. The desert is full of thieves and killers and it's not safe to go out of the palace. They believe that all people came from the sun, howevermany thousands of years ago. Is this a test?"

Jackann shook his head. "Just wondered." After a few more minutes he asked: "What language do they speak, do you know?"

"Uhh I dunnno. Mntrnao-en?"

"Probably."

"They have those big birds with long beaks and feathers on their heads, they from there right? Have you seen one?"

"Yeah, the tuccae. I've seen them but never got close. They don't let anyone near, just leave their deliveries and fly away."

"You're lucky to see all this stuff from all over the world," said Nika. "All I see are flowers. Granted sometimes we get flowers from the south, but nothing very exotic."

"You really do work in the flower shop!"

"This is as far from Tanton City as I've ever been." She said. "How about you?"

"I've been south," said Jackann. "But never east."

"Are we going near to the sea?" Asked Nika.

"No," said Jackann, somewhat surprised by her ignorance. Nika looked disappointed.

The sun and the Source were almost side by side in a sky patchy with clouds. For a little while, the light that filtered into the tram carriage was warming. Jackann shed his jacket and it wasn't long before they were both asleep again.

Jackann awoke, groggy and hungry, when the tram rattled to a stop in a station. it was getting dark, and the windows were flecked with rain.

"Are we there?" Nika was by his side.

Jackann shook hi shead and rubbed his eyes. "I... no surely not. It's too soon. What time is it?" He looked out of the window but could make nothing useful out.

The doors hissed open and five smartly dressed men boarded. Nika had gathered her things and perched on the bench beside Jackann. The men sat on the opposite side, and paid Nika and Jackann no heed.

The men were dressed in shades of deep blue and green, long shimmering robes that reached the floor, buttoned all the way up the fronts to rigid collars under their chins. Their hats were stubby black cylinders perched atop sleek shining hair.

Nika had sidled over to them before Jackann had even finished taking them in.

"Excuse me," she said. The men stopped their conversation and looked up as if seeing her for the first time. "What town is this?"

"Been on a long time have you?" Said one of them, looking over at Jackann too. His accent carried the clipped, short syllables of the north.

"This is Suna-on-Tur. If you look out on the left in a few minutes when we start up again, you'll see the river Tur. It's a grand sight!"

"Thanks. How long to Lonton?"

"All the way to Lonton are ye? A long while yet, milady. Through the night."

"Okay," said Nika, and sat dutifully on the left side of the carriage so she could look for the river through the window. The tram hummed back to life. Shortly out of the station it took them over a huge bridge, curving up and over the Tur. The river was wide enough that it contained small islands, and was the biggest body of water Nika had seen in her life. Its surface vibrated as the rain grew heavier, and was coloured a dark moody grey by the clouds.

As night set in, so did the storm. Wind whistled through the carriage and spats of water entered through imperfectly sealed windows. Nika had thrown a shawl around her shoulders and she and Jackann sat back to back, sideways on the bench. The men had all set to reading books of various sizes.

Jackann wanted to eat, but worried his supplies would be gone too fast. He had already eaten everything he had rationed himself for this journey. He didn't think he would need much, stationary as he was. But watching the world go by was surprisingly hungry work.

One of the men materialised a brown paper bag, and the others were reaching inside. The man who held the bag caught Jackann's eye and beckoned him over. 

"You'd be welcome, young travellers, to something to eat, if you like."

Jackann was hesitant; Nika was not. She brought over enough for both of them, thanking the men sweetly all the while.

"Thanks," said Jackann, to Nika for fetching and the men for providing. The slice of dark rye bread, paired with tart, salty curd of pressed beans, settled his stomach and calmed his agitated mind.

"What business have you in Lonton?" One of the men called over, conversationally.

Jackann's breath caught in his throat and he compulsively checked his pocket for the Tivnies letter.

Nika did not miss a beat. "Our dear Uncle just moved there. It's past time for a visit!"

The men nodded approvingly.

"Yourselves?" Asked Nika.

"Ah, for the burial, the burial," several of them said at once.

"I had a dear Uncle in Lonton," said one. "Alas, no more!" The men all laughed.

The tram stopped in three more small towns that evening, and their carriage gained a young woman with two fussing toddlers; an elderly couple who held hands tightly, and more smartly dressed men. The conductor came through and hung a lantern so they weren't in darkness as they had been the night before.

Jackann awoke with the sun on his face and Nika's head on his shoulder as the tram rattled to its final stop. He gently pushed her shoulder away until her head tipped and she woke with a start.

"Are we there?"

"This time, yes."

Their fellow carriage occupants were gathering their things, waiting for the doors to open. It was still raining.

The station was on the edge of Lonton, and the rest of the city spread out like a fan away from it. Jackann had a map, but the only thing marked on it was the address from the Tivnies letter. He did not yet have the courage to go there. He had contemplated telling Nika about the whole situation. He saw no real harm in doing so, only that she might march them straight there before he was ready. Maybe that was what he needed.

"Where are we going now?" She said, voice raised over the downpour, as they darted from the carriage to the shelter of the overhang of the station roof.

"Go wherever you want." Said Jackann. Nika glared at him.

"You didn't come here just to hide in the tram station. Where are *you* planning to go? Or is that top secret? Or didn't you think that far ahead yet?" She was trying to goad him into telling her his plan, he knew, and he wasn't about to let her get to him.

"Maybe I'll just take in the sights of Lonton."

Nika harumphed and marched into the station. Jackann followed her at a distance. Not interested in interfering, only in watching what she was up to, he lounged against the door frame. The station was only one room, with some threadbare cushions lying around the stone floor for sitting on, and nobody but Nika inside. A scrawny stray cersuar jumped up from its corner and approached her, mewing pathetically. Nika let it rub its head against her leg, and spared a moment to scratch it's long ears. She cringed, finding its mottled orange fur damp from the rain. She walked to the small desk in the corner and began to flip through loosely attached sheets of paper to look for the schedules of other trams out of the city.

"Ha!" She cried.

"What," Jackann mumbled from the doorway, curious in spite of himself.

"The burial.. the men on the tram said there's a burial. There are no more trams out for three days because of it."

"Huh. Must be a big deal." Said Jackann.

"Let's go into the center and find out what's going on. Maybe a place to stay. Or did you have other plans?"

"Sure. Sounds like a start."

Jackann pulled up his hood and Nika wrapped her shawl around her head, and they went out into the rain. They followed the main street, a straight line, which was signposted toward the city center.

Unlike Tanton City, which had kept much of its historic character - bubbly dome houses and rambling alleyways - Lonton was new. Its buildings were several storeys tall and jarringly angular. Residences took up the higher floors, while stores and workshops were at the street level. The roads were wider, with space for trolleys down the center and walking on both sides. The pavements were angled carefully so that water from the rain drained away, rather than gather in puddles. Jackann and Nika walked for thirty minutes before they reached the main square. Inkeeping with the overall shape of the city, the square was actually a triangle. 

Here, some history seemed to have been preserved. The building lining the square had intricately carved stone facades and domed roofs. Everything was coloured in pastel shades: pinks, blues, greens, yellows. The domes were deep midnight blue or gold, gleaming in the downpour. But Jackann knew from school this whole city had been levelled during the Last Balan War. Still, it was hard to believe so much work had gone into this pefect reconstruction of Lonton's center.

The two of them gaped for a while, getting wetter by the second.

At the far end of the square, the not-pointy end of the triange, a small flurry of people were putting together a raised platform. They worked under a large canopy, unbothered by the rain.

Jackann and Nika walked slowly direclty through the middle of the open space. The tiles under their feet seemed to be a mix of old and new; some slick and slippery marble, worn smooth with age, and others a ridged orange brick. There was no pattern or coherence to their layout. At intervals the tiles were interrupted by narrow, triangular raised flower beds. Nothing much was flowering though; tangles of stems and green leaves filled the space.

Jackann jumped at the sound of a huge gong. They turned to see on the building they had passed at the very point of the triangle, towering over everything, a giant clock. It was marked around the edges with the six symbols for each phase of the Source, each embossed in silver or something like it. It had three hands: one large and two small; two silver and one golden. The biggest hand had struck *ke-fa*, and in conjunction with a smaller golden hand that indicated where the sun should be in the sky, it meant the time of day for bathing and cleaning. Nobody put much stock in Sourcetime these days, but of course Jackann's father had a small version of a clock like this in his study, so Jackann had learned to read one. Nika had never seen anything like it, only a picture of one at school. 

Early as it was, it started to feel like Lonton was waking up. People began to materialise out of the lanes that opened onto the triangular square. A young woman pulling a small cart clattered along the cobbles for a bit before kicking out a strut and setting it still in her spot. The side of the cart opened to reveal all manner of hanging pots and pans, packets of dried and shredded leaves, glasses and cups. The rain began to ease off.

"Do you smell that?" Said Nika, and veered off at once down a side street. Jackann followed her, with nothing else to do than let her lead while he tried to get his head together.

Nika's nose led them to a small shop front, with tables and chairs outside covered by an awning. A bedraggled looking family of three or four generations were gathered around a large table, in the process of being served sizzling clay plates by a rotund man in an apron.

Jackann's stomach rumbled, and it was almost like the man heard because he turned to the pair and gestured warmly that they sit while he went back inside.

"Nika, we're going to have to pay for-"

Nika waved the problem away. "It's fine!" She pulled up a chair.

The waiter returned and placed steaming metal cups down in front of the two of them. "Sweet or salty?" He asked.

"Both!" Piped up Nika at once, her mouth already watering as she clasped her cold wet hands around the cup, then let go quickly with a half-supressed yelp.

"One of each," the waiter smiled and went back inside.

Jackann sniffed his cup. It was dark and bitter lassar tea, brewed from the sap of lassarette trees that were common across Tantonia. "What did we order?" He asked Nika, too lazy to crane his neck to see what the family were tucking into.

"Breakfast," she smiled, "mimiyuas." Nika was alternately blowing on her tea and trying to slurp it without lifting the cup. She had tucked her hands into her sleeves to try to hold it without scalding herself.

Not much later the mimiyuas arrived, thick yellowish pancakes sputtering on  hot dishes. The one placed in front of Jackann was set with richly caramelised plantain slices and scattered with chopped nuts. Nika's was threaded with purple veins of string beans and splattered with a thick grey sauce containing chunks of edible fungus.

The waiter held out his hand to Nika. "Five," he said.

Her head disappeared for a moment as she dug into her backpack, which she had dropped under her chair, and Jackann heard the clink of coins as she passed her small hand over the waiter's large one.

"Enjoy!" The waiter said cheerily, moving on to seat some new arrivals.

Nika dug in with a small, narrow spatula from the table, deftly slicing bite sized chunks with the bottom edge and scooping them into her mouth with the flat side of the wooden implement. Jackann soon followed her example. His pancake and fruit mix was dense and sour, and paired perfectly with the lassar. He swallowed a gulp, now it had cooled a little, between each bite.

Nika had cleared half of her plate when she gestured, mouth still full, that she wanted to try his. They swapped, sliding the clay dishes carefully across the table as they were still too hot to hold onto for long. The beans in the salty mimiyua tasted earthy, and the clump of mushroom sauce that Nika had been kind enough to leave behind was creamy but bland.

They sat in silence for a few minutes. The waiter reappeared to take their plates and refill their cups from a large kettle he carried, its handle wrapped with a towel.

"Okay, now I'm ready for whatever today brings!" Nika exclaimed.

The rain was getting heavier again.

"Nika, I should.. I should pay for half of that." Said Jackann, reaching for his bag.

"No, I know you don't really need to eat ever apparently and this was my brainwave so I'll take responsibility."

Jackann, though relieved, was still torn.

"Consider it my present to you for getting me out of Tanton City."

He smiled. "Sure. Just don't-"

"I'll do what I want. I'll try not to rope you in all the time though."

"That's all I was going to say."

"So you do *have* a plan right? Or were you just gonna come out here and wing it? But you do have some money too right? What's going on?"

"I planned how much I would need to bring. Well, I brought everything I had.  I need to be careful how I spend it if it's going to last. I wasn't expecting to be stuck in Lonton for three days, if we can't get out before then."

"Last how long? Last until when? What are you up to?"

"I have... There's someone in Lonton I should find. Then I will know what to do next."

"Oh cool, so this is like a one clue at a time type thing. Okay. Who is this person?"

"Uh. A friend of my father's. I hope."

"That sounds ominous. Know where he lives?"

Jackann nodded.

"Going to share? Is it nearby? Oh! You don't want me to come with you. Well, that's fine."

"It's not that," he sighed. "I haven't really... I don't know how it's going to go. I haven't imagined it. I can't because I don't know anything about them. The person. I'm not ready."

"Well unless you have some way to get more information, you never will. Gotta just go."

"Sure. Maybe later."

"Okay, well we have to figure out somewhere to go while you psyche yourself up or whatever."

They walked back into the triangular square when the rain had abated a little to find even more people milling around, setting things up. A group had begun laying out pads to sit on in the open space in neat rows, heedless of the rain that was soaking them. Nika walked over to one of them.

"What's all this for?" She somehow managed to be demanding and polite at the same time.

"The burial of course!" The man turned away to continue layout out the cushions.

"Sorry... Whose burial?"

"Get a knock on the head did you? *The* burial. Of everyone who died since the last one. Happens every cycle you know."

"Right. Of course. I uh forgot what day it was."

She sidled back over to Jackann. "Did you hear? Any idea?"

Jackann nodded. "Yes. They keep the tradition here of burying the dead at sok ta I guess, when the sun and the Source and the moon are all in the sky at at the same time. [TODO replace this with whatever orbital arrangement makes sense]"

"Oh. So it's like a public thing?"

"Certainly looks that way."

They began meandering around the edge of the triangle, looking up at the ornate buildings and guessing what some of them were. They came upon one, clearly signposted as a museum, just as the rain got heavy again. Nika pushed the heavy wooden door and a bell jangled on the inside, somewhere far off or high up. She peered through the gap.

"Come on," she beckoned to Jackann with her head, and they both slipped inside. 

It was eerily quiet after the clatter of the town square, and the sound of the downpour was almost completely shut out. All they could hear was the plink plonk of their sodden clothes dripping steadily onto a marble floor, and the thundering of their hearts in their chests. They found themselves in a spacious foyer. Far above their heads was a domed glass window with coloured panels. But the light that filtered through it from the cloud-filled sky outside was dim. Ahead of them were two flights of stairs which turned back on themselves and joined up in the middle. Directly in between the two flights was a table and an empty chair. They haltingly approached to find an untidy pile of leaflets and little else. Jackann picked one up while Nika veered off to the side of the foyer where she had spotted a standing glass case.

"It's The Museum of the Empire," Jackann read from the paper. He flipped it over to find a simple map of the floors.

"Wow look at this!" Nika was peering close to the glass case at whatever was inside. Jackann walked over. "It's a skeleton!"

The glass was grimy but inside they could see what did appear to be a full-sized human skeleton, decked out in a plumed helmet, ornate breastplate, and with its hand wrapped around the hilt of a sword almost as tall as it was.

Jackann read the sign on the case: "General from c. E300 buried in full armour. Batia village necropolis. B166."

"Woah it's seven hundred years old!" Nika exclaimed. "Where's Batia village?"

"Maybe we'll find out if we read more signs," suggested Jackann.

"Yeah this seems like as good a place to hang out today as any. Look, that arrow says go that way." She pointed to a sign reading *exhibition begins* which indicated another large wooden door. Jackann shrugged. They went inside.

They had both been taught the history of the Tantonian Empire in school, but only remembered snippets, random stories. The big events, in its seven hundred and eighty six year history, like the expansion into the south west; or the gruesome ones, like the time an Emperor had brutally murdered all of his close advisors.

The museum layout was a chronological around the edge of a corridor-like room that ran around the outside of three of the sides of the foyer. At the far end were stairs, and this repeated for four floors.

Jackann began reading the signs in order, but Nika ran back and forth from artefact to artefact giving a running commentary of all she was discovering.

"Did you know the Sourcelands were even like how they are right at the start of the Empire?" She said, peering at an enormous map of Balan on the wall.

"Yeah, I see," said Jackann, trying to read a placard about the first founding of the Empire.

"Did you know the first city of the Empire was right in the middle of Balan! Almost at UEB. Why do you think they went west instead of east?"

"Guess we'll find out," he moved on to a diagram of marriages and descendants of the regional rulers which had united and strengthened the Empire over the first couple of hundred years.

Nika ran off ahead, and came back a few minutes later. "It was because the mountains in the southeast and the Sourcelands in the northeast, and on the other side of the mountains was a great race of warriors who rode lions and elephants called the Soo-mar! I never heard of them before, did you know about that?"

"I did not."

Eventually Nika's energy began to diminish, though she continued to pace up and down, reading the displays out of order.

Jackann's eyes were following the words on the signs, and taking in the artefacts and pictures, but his mind wandered. What was he doing in here while the Professor and Lark got further and further east? He stopped by a tapestry depicting battles over the Tantonian coastal regions, with a map beside it. They still had *so far* to go to the Sourcelands, but he was many days behind. He didn't know if it would be possible to catch them, even if he could leave Lonton right that minute. 

That morning Jackann read at least a dozen different names for the Sourcelands from throughout history. It was during the late stages of the Empire, around E650, that some scientists had made a connection between the glowing wastelands and the blue star in their sky. The history of the Sourcelands, of course, he knew well from his father's work. It was the only part of Tantonia that had never been contested, never invaded. It shared a border with Tivnies and United East Balan that nobody had tried to cross. Why it was part of Tantonia in the first place though he had no idea. It had been de-facto included in the early Tantonian Empire. Perhaps because it was such a good defensive mechanism. But for all he knew, he mused, Tivnies and UEB both called it their own as well. 

But surely his father wouldn't be going there if it wasn't part of Tantonia. That would make no sense at all. It wouldn't be possible, even.

The first two hundred years of the Tantonian Empire were years of unification and peace-making (according to the museum). The first self-declared Emporer, Sohamain Gsing had invited nearby settlements to his hilltop stronghold during a time of famine and shared supplies that his people had stockpiled over decades. Other villages and nomadic peoples from miles around heard and flocked to him. They expanded the stronghold into the First City, Oiim. The spread, overseen over the decades by Sohamain Gsing's children and siblings' children, was slow and consenting, west through the steppes of the middle of the continent.

The beginning of the Sourcelands was north of the historical location of Oiim, of which no trace remained these days, and they continued even further east. Jackann had no idea how far into the Sourcelands his father was planning to go. He had no real concept of how big they really were.

What if whatever the Professor was supposed to pick up in Lonton was crucial for his journey?

The stairs led to a similar exhibit, about the next two hundred years of history. The various Emperors, in between political intrigues and suppressed coups and murders and exiles, conquered the coastal city-states one by one. These were much more developed than the interior of the region, and the glass cases held many more artefacts from the time. 

Nika's attention had been immediately caught by a reconstruction half way down the hall of a house made from seashells. The shells were slim concave ovals about the size of her hand, a shimmering black laced delicately with blues and greens. She walked around it, inspecting from every angle, running her hands across the shapes. "None of these exist any more, Jackann!" She called back to him. "What a shame! I'd love to live in a house like this."

*Or any house at all,* Jackann thought, but didn't say anything.

Jackann paused to gaze at a display full of fine jewellery, supposedly between five and seven hundred years old. The chains and rings were made from combinations of precious metals and shells using a technique unique to the east part of the coast. He wondered vaguely why they were here and not in museums in the coastal cities instead.

"I wish I could go to the coast," Nika was saying, around a corner somewhere. "Do you remember Ellann and Potaka?" She reappeared.

"Yeah, why?" Two kids they had been at school with, siblings or cousins, somewhere around their own age.

"They went to the coast for a holiday every Season of the Sky. Every year! I think they had relatives in Tratton or something. And then they'd go out of the city and stay somewhere quiet, to somewhere they could get down to the sea. Isn't it amazing? I was always jealous."

"Yeah," said Jackann absently. "Me too."

"You went south though. To the mountains?"

"Only once," he said.

"What is it like?"

Jackann sighed and turned to face Nika. "It was kind of a complicated trip. It wasn't a holiday. My mother was supposed to come back with us and then she didn't. So not great." He almost growled.

"Oh," Nika looked downcast. "Sorry." Then hesitantly, "I know the feeling."

Jackann didn't press, didn't feel like a heart to heart in that moment. 

Nika walked away and Jackann stared, unfathomnably angrily, at some ornately carved stone dishes. He took a few deep breaths. What if Lark thought his brother had abandoned him?

[TODO]

Setiny Hill turned out to be a famous landmark, and they found it quickly enough. It was in the north eastern quarter of the city, a smooth knoll rising up from the sea of low, flat-roofed houses, covered over every meter with garish painted statues. Hundreds of them. The statues were cylindrical, varying in heights but each about as tall as Nika, with domed tops. Into their sides shapes were carved, and they were painted in bright reds, blues and greens to have grotesque faces with wide laughing mouths, twisted noses and round staring eyes. Some of them had brows that made them seem angry or maniacal. 

"What the Source," said Nika as they approached. "These things are *horrifying*. Why would they have something like this?"

"Beats me," said Jackann, although he remembered reading in the museum that they were something to do with commemorating the number of battles won by some of the Emperors. What he didn't understand was why they had reconstructed it after it was destroyed in the War. The whole assemblage was hideous.

They walked to the entrance to the main path up the hill, designated by a white pillared archway.

"Okay so walk left," Jackann muttered, and they did so, counting the houses to their right as they went. After twelve they turned right, and counted six more before they reached a small park. The park was unremarkable, one of many identical ones throughout Lonton City. The house at the far end of the park was just the same as the ones either side of it. They approached the front door.

"Here goes nothing," said Jackann, and knocked.

The silence stretched out. Jackann strained to hear movement on the other side of the door. He was about to give up when footsteps approached. The door opened softly, timidly. On the other side of it stood a young woman, her head covered with a light blue scarf, and her eyes swollen from crying. She was beautiful. Jackann's mouth open and closed wordlessly for a few seconds before Nika stepped in.

"We're sorry to bother you," she said brightly, "but we've been sent to make a collection. Is Professor Ardua home?"

The woman sucked in a sharp breath. "How do you know him?" She whispered.

Jackann began rooting in his pockets. "He wrote a letter to-"

The woman gasped, "come in, come in," ushering them inside. She looked around nervously as she closed the door.

"You're too late," she said.

Jackann stopped looking for the letter and started. "What?"

"They took him away. You shouldn't be here. It's not safe. I can't talk about it. You shouldn't be here."

Nika got straight to the point. "This may sound strange, but we only have half the picture. Things didn't go all the way to plan and the person who should be here, well, isn't. So do you mind filling in some of the blanks?"

"Oh, no, you should really go," the woman groaned and began to sob.

"I'm sorry lady, but not until we know what's going on!" Insisted Nika. "Where are we supposed to go next?"

"Nika, really, leave her be," said Jackann, embarrassed.

"You're really going to go out there?" She looked up.

"Yes," said Jackann, assuming she meant the Sourcelands, "we are."

"Okay then," she was wiping her eyes and composing herself. "Then you should take them. But you're so young... I suppose nobody would suspect you. Maybe there is hope after all. But it's a long way.."

"We know that," said Nika. "We knew that when we set out. What are we taking?"

"Come with me." They followed her into a nondescript back room, and then down some stairs into a basement. It was lit by Sourcelamps hanging from the ceiling, and decorated cosily, with wall hangings and bookshelves, and cushions all around to sit on. In the middle of the room, two children were reading. They looked up at the same time.

"Atta, Dipa," said the woman as they approached. "Pack your things. You're going after all."

Behind her, Jackann and Nika exchanged a look of horror.

## Suari (escapes)

Suari was lurking in the scullery when the revolution started. She wasn't ever supposed to be down there, but preparations for her brothers' feast were well underway and the hustle and bustle of the dishwashers was calm compared to the frantic pandemonium going on everywhere else. Kinds her own age worked there. Suari considered herself above talking to them. The common dialect of Mnt, with its sharp edges and guttural stops, hurt her ears to hear and her throat to reproduce. If she spoke in the high tongue of Allia-um, which she had been taught from birth, the others laughed, mimicked, and wouldn't understand. Or they would have, were she not the princess. In reality they gave her as wide a berth as she gave them.

Suari sat instead with the lerpanas. Gentle creatures with long thick sand coloured fur and large floppy ears, they devoured food waste, insects and rodents indiscriminately. The largest of them reached her shoulder; she used to ride them when she was younger but felt herself too big for that now. She did look forward to introducing them to her sisters though.

A lerpana she called Doya lolled on its back with its head in Suari's lap. She absently ruffled Doya's fur, fondled its ears, and played with the huge flat fluffy paws. Doya had just taken care of a basket of soft, almost fermenting pikka fruit - sticy blue remnants of which covered it's muzzle - and was thinking about taking a nap.

Two men in aprons with flour-covered hands entered the scullery, heads bowed, talking earnestly. Suari couldn't make out their words but noticed the fraught air they brought in with them. She thought no more of it as kindly Durrel, a middle-aged kitchen runner with a soft spot for the princess, sat down beside Suari with a tray of fresh baked fruit tarts. They were all misshapen in some way.

"Hello Durrel", said Suari, giving the dark-skinned woman permission to address her.

"My princess," Durrel spoke in a satisfactory attempt at the high tongue. "None of these came out right, but they're not altogether wrong either. Perhaps you'd like to sample? They're as good in taste as the ones that will to the feast, just not quite as pretty."

Suari forgot her composure, faced with the tray of sweet treats. "Yes!" she exclaimed, helping herself directly. Around pastry and tangy filling she muttered "too good for these beasts for sure!" She meant the lerpanas, but Durrel had half a mind she meant the scullery staff as well, and laughed good naturedly.

"I hope my princess doesn't mind if I offer them to the workers as well?"

"Please do," said Suari. "I should save space for the feast." It didn't occur to her to wonder what the workers ate while she and her family were feasting, or any of the rest of the time either.

Durrel stood, turned, and collided with the aproned men who were crossing the room bound for the entrance to the kitchens. Fruit tarts went flying. Suari caught one, but the wrong way up, and berry juice droplets splattered her front. Doya and its siblings made short work of the rest. Suari giggled as a long, black lerpana tongue tried to clean her of the sweet mess.

"What's she doing here?" hissed one of the men, too hasty to apologise to Durrel.

"Hiding from all the people running about the place with furniture and cows and candlesticks and whatever else I imagine," said Durrel, scowling. "What does it- oh! Is it happening?"

"Soon," gruffly, "send her to her mother. And get your own children by your side, if you can."

Suari scowled. Seated on the floor she might be, but these people were workers and talking about her as if she couldn't hear or understand. She opened her mouth to remind them of their place, but they were already off without a second glance her way.

Durrel dejectedly stooped to pick up the fallen tray. Her eyes were dark and sad when they met Suari's.

"Princess, you know where Alla and Hera play?" Suari nodded. Durrel's grandchildren were Suari's own age, more or less. Their skin was almost the same colour as hers, redder maybe, but lighter than Durrel's. Suari had never known who their parents were. 

"Go to them, princess, if you would. I will come shortly, and bring some more treats for all of you. But we must get you away from ... the lerpanas right now. They're - they're not clean."

Suari could smell a lie, but something in Durrel's voice compelled her. And Alla and Hera weren't as loud or obnoxious as most of the other worker children.

"It will be okay, I promise." Durrel added. Which only draw Suari's attention to the idea that things suddenly might not be okay after all.

Suari hurried along to the Jade Gallery. This finely decorated room, with velvet furnishings and precious stones from far away islands, was used for smaller gatherings of her father's dignitories. Tonight it would serve as an overflow room for the crowds of guests who needed places to lounge after the feast. Suari padded lightly for ten minutes through halls on the level above the scullery, dodging hurrying workers who paid her no heed. A great carved sandstone door closed the Gallery off from the corridor; it took two men or more to open. *The feast preparations must have gone wrong,* Suari thought. *Father will be furious. My brothers will be glad!* She found the panel behind the tapestry that covered the wall beside the great door, and inched it open with all her strength. Heavy dark wood ground against the stone slot that held it, as it slid sideways into a crevasse in the neighbouring stone. The passage behind was lit with small torches at interludes along the wall. Suari dragged the panel back in place behind her and descended the narrow steps which lead into the room under the Jade Gallery. The Jade Basement, she thought of it. The area was used for storage, only lightly, and occupied by desert rodents and worker children a lot of the time. Suari wasn't allowed to go there, either, which was part of why Durrel's direct command appealed more than it would have done if she had sent her to the Empress like the man had said.

Suari heard the chatter of children as she reached the bottom of the steps. More than just Alla and Hera. They dropped almost at once to silence when she stepped into the room. Suari felt all eyes on her.

"I came from Durrel." She announced.

A young woman called Fray stood up from where she had been attending to a fussing three year old. "Where is Durrel?" she asked Suari directly in the common dialect, without any airs or graces.

Suari stuttered. "Coming. Durrel will come."

Fray chewed her lip and beckoned the princess. "Do you know what happens?" She asked in a crude and coarse mashup of Allia-um with words from the common speech.

"Something is wrong," Suari guessed. "Why are all the children here?" The noise level in the room rose back to a low buzz, pierced occasionally by a wail or a laugh. "Why are you here?" Fray ordinarily worked in the stables, Suari recalled. She didn't belong in the palace.

"Princess," Fray reached forward to stroke Suari's hair, then thought better of it. "Yes. Something is wrong. I think, for tonight, you should not be the princess."

Suari cocked her head. This had just entered the realm of the absurd. Fray seemed to be working out what to say.

"Princess, Suari, we are all leaving." Fray gestured around the room. "You can come with us. But not the princess."

Suari did not understand.

Fray ran her fingers through her own hair, which was thick and curly. "It is... not safe. In the palace. Not tonight."

"Are you coming back?" Asked Suari. "Can my sisters come?"

"Your sisters," murmured Fray. There were tears in her eyes. "Your sisters are with the Empress."

To Suari that implied they were safe. "I should go to the Empress?"

"No," said Fray at once. "You should come with us. They won't look for you if they don't find you upstairs. You'll be safe with us."

Suari looked around at the room of dusty, grimy children with dark hair in various states of disarray, and tunics universally the colour of dirt. Everyone in the room had bare feet except her. Suari felt a head taller than them all. Her dress was blue silk, speckled with purple berry juice. She held her head high where the workers slouched and looked down. Her forehead was smooth and flat, shaped sharply back above her brows and the back of her head extended almost twice as far as the others, as none of them had been bound as babies. Her hair - a wig - was thick and neatly plaited and sparkling.

It seemed as though Fray wanted to disguise her. How could she not be the princess? She would always be the princess. Her golden skin itself glowed.

Durrel and three other women from the scullery stumbled into the room. They bore bulging sacks over their shoulders. Suari saw Alla and Hera in the scramble of children that had appeared around the women's feet. Durrel made a beeline for Suari and Fray.

"Here," she stuffed a plain brown sack into Fray's hand. "Dress her. We have to move."

"Suari, over your dress please, for warmth." Fray wrestled the sack - it was in fact a tunic, rough to the princess's touch - over her head. Suari barely had time to protest. Durrel was gone, then back again. In the distance was an enormous crash. Someone outside in the palace screamed. The children were loud, many more were crying. Older children were herding younger ones into groups.

Fray pulled out horsehair brush and attempted to undo Suari's plait and pick out the gold. "Just take it off," said Durrel, reaching over to pull the wig from the princess's head.

To Suari's own horror, she began to cry. "What is *happening*?"

Durrel ran her fingers through the tangle of lank hair, comforting the child with her touch as well as trying to make it look less like she had been wearing a wig for most of her life.

"It'll be over soon, sweetie," Durrel cooed.

Suari sobbed. "I'm the princess! Take me to the Empress!"

"Not now, not now," Durrel held Suari's tiny wrists in one strong hand to stop her from fighting, and deftly wrapped her enlarged head in a scarf with the other.

"Where are we going?" Suari gasped, trying to pull herself together.

"To somewhere safe," was all Durrel would say. "Hold this," the woman placed a firm green fruit in Suari's hands. Suari stared at it dumbly. 

"What is it?" Commanded Durrel.

"Pollomo," said Suari.

Durrel shook her head. "What do we call it?"

Suari scowled. "Sabbo."

"You're clever, pri- child. You always were. A fast learner. You deserve another chance. Your name is Sabbo. Just for now. Okay? Keep this so you don't forget. And don't speak in Allia-um if you can. You need... everyone to understand you."

Durrel threw a kintted cloak around Suari's shoulders as the girl nodded slowly, mouth agape, trying to take everything in.

A grating sound echoed through the hall. Suari thought she could hear horses somewhere close, galloping, but that was impossible. Someone had removed a stone from the floor. Another passage was revealed, one Suari had never seen before. The children were herded down into it in their groups.

"Stay close," said Durrel. Suari obeyed. She was Sabbo now. Sabbo was cool under pressure, and strong like the worker children. Sabbo's head felt light and free without the weight of someone else's hair she had never realised had been oppressing her.

The princess was just one in a crowd as the children poured into the tunnels. The older ones held burning torches, and Suari could see almost nothing but the dots of flame. She let herself be hustled along, thinking only of the round, pale green fruit she clutched in her hand.

The passage went on and on, sometimes wider, sometimes narrowing so much they had to squeeze through it in single file. The hand that wasn't occupied with the fruit held that of a child, and another clung to her tunic behind. She couldn't see either of their faces.

At times the line faltered, stopped and started up again. Once a crash right above them made the walls rattle, dust and stones fell, and some children whimpered. Suari as Sabbo stayed silent. For the most part, they were all silent.

She had heard tales of the palace being invated from tunnels below, but never thought of them as true. Nobody had ever showed her the tunnels, or even spoken of using them personally. Could they really lead beyond the palace grounds? Was that where they were going?

Suari had never been in the city proper. The palace grounds were expansive and had everything her and her family needed. The city was just there because... not everyone would fit in the palace, right? She had no reason to believe life in Mntrnao was any different. Maybe the Empress and her sisters would meet her there after all.

The crowd stopped again, and suari could hear hushed voices. They had reached a fork and more people had appeared. The new people joined them, and they all proceeded down the left branch.

Some minutes later the ground began to slope upwards. Suari noticed at first that she suddenly felt heavier, then realised why. There was light ahead. They emerged into a wider chamber, lit around its walls with torches. A mound in the middle of the room turned out to be bread and water when someone pulled off the cloth that covered it. Older children handed pieces of food around to the younger ones. Suari drank to clear the dust from her throat, but did not eat. Her feet hurt. She hoped the walking was over for a while.

As she sat, fiddling with her sandal straps and flicking grit from the inside of the sole where it irritated her feet, someone dropped down beside her. It was Eliah.

"How are you, child?" the girl said, in common speak.

"Tired." Suari shrugged.

"I brought this for you." Eliah placed into Suari's hand the green pouch. Suari gaped. "For you to remember..." She gestured vaguely around. "I have to go. Keep it safe."

Suari stared dumbly for a second, then hastened to fasten it around her body. She could not get it under her clothes right now, but that could wait. She didn't open the pouch, but could tell its contents by touch. The last letter from Jackann, and the start of her reply. A crinkly old map of the world outside the palace. The latter might come in handy, Suari half thought. She opened the fastening just enough to pop her sabbo inside as well.

They rested there a while. Suari heard one of the older children say they were to stay until it was dark outside. But not what they would do then.

## Jackann (finds a guide)

## Suari (in the city)

Hours blurred into days, and all that Suari saw was sand. She began to forget everything she had known. All that existed was the pain in her feet (tattered sandals, never made for heavy use, long discarded) and the sweaty grip of two nameless children by her side. Only the green pouch kept her grounded. The bump of the sabbo fruit reminding her who she was, and the crinkle of the parchment a hint of who she used to be.

Once they left the tunnels, they did not spend long taking in fresh air. Above ground was chaos, day and night. Suari glimpsed unfamiliar streets full of dark, dirty, unfamiliar faces as she was shepherded between crude brick houses and lopsided tents. Sometimes she slept on sheets or shawls, but mostly sand. They ate only bread, and little of that. Suari had not seen Durrel in an age, forgotten her rescuer's (kidnapper's?) face by now. Eliah was still with her, sometimes.

There was never quiet. Suari missed the peace of the palace gardens where the only sounds were a burbling fountain and maybe distant chatter of her mother's entourage. She missed the silence of the High Library, where the turning of a page caused a ruckus. She missed them without knowing what it was that was missing. Only that the endless crashing of feet and incomprehensible hollering voices was too much. All day and all night, the clattering of carts, the stomping of hooves, the clamour of people buying and selling and trading and stealing. Through it all she obediently marched, followed, was pulled.

The pair whose hands she held were littler than Suari, and never spoke. They never cried. But when the opportunity came, they ate with gusto. Their dark eyes were always cast down.

Suari's skin had always been the colour of sand. In the palace, this meant golden, glowing, radiant under desert sun. Out here, wherever here was, the sand was trodden down, hard, dirtied by soot and waste and many thousands of feet. The colour of sand, she remained.

When the group - smaller than when they started, she was sure - came to rest in one place for a few days, it was a welcome reprieve. 

They climbed, one by one, up some rickety wooden stairs, to a rickety wooden house. They did this under cover of night. Though the Blue Sun glowed softly overhead, Suari was too tired to look around under its light. When she realised she could sleep, she slept.

She slept for longer than she had in days, weeks? When she awoke, the racket of the city was still all around, but somehow more distant. Suari rubbed her eyes, moving sand around between her eyes and her hands.

A sparse room came into focus. She and four other children were on a rough hewn mat of reeds which covered most of the wooden floor. Two of the others were taking it in turns to drink from a pitcher, and the other two lay prone on the floor.

Her mouth was dry and sticky. She crawled towards the duo with water, and they yielded it to her at once. It tasted sour and brackish and made her head spin.

The whole room creaked when she moved. Three of the uneven walls were wooden, but the fourth was rock. Sunlight came in through a window that was too high for Suari to see out of. She tried peering through a crack between the wooden slats, but couldn't make sense of anything she saw.

Her stomach thundered. She felt the weight of the sabbo against her body, softer now than it had been, but didn't think to eat it. If she had taken it out she would have found it brown and bruised.

Suari squatted in a corner of the room. The two children with the pitcher had gone back to sleep. She hitched up her dress and emptied her bowels.

Then she wondered where everyone else was. And what she should do. She was still tired and aching, but not bone weary. She was weak from hunger and queasy from the water, but a night's sleep had been enough to give her back her wits.

There was no door to the room, simply an opening leading to the stairs by which they had entered.

The ceiling was high, Suari realised. She crawled to the base of the rock wall, and tipped her head back to gaze up at it. It was angled in toward the room, rugged but impossible to climb. The ceiling above was slanted downward too, wooden planks like the floor, covered above in straw.

Just as Suari was starting to wonder what would happen if she just... left... the stairs began to creak under the weight of bodies on them. Suari was too exhausted to feel any emotion strongly in that moment, but she did experience a twinge of relief when a familiar face came into view.

Eliah smiled wearily at the not-princess, and reached into the basket she was carrying. Bread and dates! Suari filled her stomach.

"Be careful, don't choke," warned one of the other women who had ascended behind Eliah. Suari was sucking the flesh from the dates hurriedly, barely pausing to spit out the pips.

"Bis," said Eliah from across the room. Suari looked around; Eliah's face was distraught, and her arms held one of the sleeping children. Then in a moment that would carve itself vividly into Suari's memory for the rest of her life, Eliah said: "She's dead."

The woman Eliah had addressed made her way across the room. Bis was older, stocky, her face lined with years. She seemed not to react. "What was her name?"

"I don't know." Eliah didn't look like she knew much right then. She stared dumbly at the bundle.

"Whose was she?"

Eliah shook her head.

"Put her down, El." Bis was trying to be kind, but sounded exasperated. "Nothing to be done."

Eliah sat, but did not relinquish the body.

A third woman was rousing the other children and making them eat. She produced a single milkfruit, pierced its hard shell with a knife, and took it to each child in turn. She tipped it carefully, allowing only a dribble of the nutritious liquied into each mouth so that there was enough for all.

Suari used to drink milkfruit every morning in the palace. It was a chore and she had come to resent the flavour. But this one tasted sweet and creamy, life-restoring.

The children had become more animated. Bis pryed the dead one from Eliah and sent Eliah around to learn the names of the others.

"Sabbo," Suari joined in before Eliah could say anything else. "Nice to meet you," she said politely, directed at the other children. They said nothing. One, the smallest, asked Eliah when his mother was coming.

"Come, all of you," said Bis. "We have something to show you." They followed her onto the stairs and proceeded further up, not down. They stepped onto a roof. Suari's breath caught in her throat at the view over the city before them.

The house was attached to a rock formation on the very outskirts of Mntrnao. The land on which the city was built was largely flat, but here right as the true desert began, long ago the earth had coughed up this jagged protrusion. Wooden dwellings clung to the side of it wherever there was a big enough outcropping. At this height, the entire city stretched clearly out before them. It looked nothing like the Hazmars' maps. Immediately below them were wooden lean-tos and tents, all jumbled up. They stretched around the entire semi circle of the city's circumference, right up to where it halted abruptly at the Valley of Clouds. In the very center was the palace. Its high walls obscured the extensive and colourful grounds that Suari knew were inside. Five high towers poked over the top, as well as the dark jagged tip of the palace core.

In between the ramshackle dwellings and the palace were more stable looking homes of brick and mud. They had three or four storeys each, and were packed tightly together. There were occasional gaps for a marketplace or somewhere to gather animals.

The palace was so far away, Suari could hardly grasp that she had walked that distance. Or how long it must have taken.

The houses reached the palace walls, and in some places were built against them. Suari's eyes traced the stone, familiar but unfamiliar from this side. In one place, the mud structures were piled so high up the wall that they reached the top. They ceased to look like rooms at that point and more like a ramp. Suari squinted. People were climbing it, in both directions, over the wall, in and out.

Her eyes found the palace gate. It was, uncharacteristically, open. *It must be something to do with the princes' ascension,* she thought.

Suari knew the Imperial Fountain was just beyond the gate, but out of sight from this angle. What she could see instead were even more people coming and going, many on horseback.

She was too far away to truly hear the clamour of the city, but her brain filled it in for her.

There was a distant roar of voices, and the crowd of people at the palace gate intensified. They were bringing something out. It looked like an enormous piece of rock, like the one she was standing beside.

"It is done," one of the older women breathed. To the children nearest to her she said: "We are free!"

Eliah squeezed Suari's shoulder.

"What is happening?" Suari asked softly, in Allia-um.

She recognised the thing that had been brought out of the palace just as people began to break it apart with hammers and rocks. That colossal stone had her grandfather's face.

Eliah said "Sabbo. We will find a place for you."

Suari's eyes drifted from the palace walls to what was beyond. The clouds in the Valley were still and calm. Smooth and white like the inside of a milkfruit. It seemed as though she could walk across them. To where? Jackann was on the other side.

If she must leave Mntrnao, which she must, she knew with unquestioning certainty, Tantonia should be her destination. She would find a way across Jackann's 'White Sea'.

Suari and the other three children stayed in the house on the rock side for another week with nothing changing. People came and went and told them in different ways that the *world* was changing, but Suari didn't see any of it firsthand. Eliah brought food most days, and if she didn't someone else did. Sometimes bread and dates, sometimes fruit, sometimes a purplish porridge of mashed roots. They didn't have milkfruit again. Mostly Suari sat on the roof, looking over the city and the palace and trying to reconcile this version with what she thought she knew. 

It was much larger out here than she ever imagined. There were more houses and more people and more going on. She thought that everything happened inside the palace walls, and outside was just where food was grown and some trading happened. She didn't realise people lived whole lives out here.

One morning when she awoke the youngest child was gone. "His mother came for him," was all Bis said, when she asked. The other two still never spoke.

Suari felt hot, and dirty and agitated. She eyed the stairs leading down to the ground with more interest every day. But she didn't take them, even though for most of the day there was nobody paying any attention to her at all. She didn't know what she would find down there. But something else was stopping her. It was as though she was waiting for something.

When Bis came back one afternoon with three other children and a large basket, she knew something was changing.

"Time for you to earn your keep," Bis announced. The silent pair crawled over to join the circle. They looked pale and sickly. Bis began taking things out of the basket. She passed each of the children a small, sharp blade, and then unloaded an armful of reeds. "All watching? Do it like this," she demonstrated. Bis took a knife and peeled away the outer green skin of the reed. "Then this," as she skimmed layer after layer of the pale inside, turning it into flat strips. She worked fast. "Now you do it."

Suari held the knife clumsily. It didn't even have a handle, just a shard of metal blunt along one edge but still uncomfortable to grip. She pried away at the reed until she got purchase and could remove the green layer. The other children were done much faster than her, and were already slicing.

They worked at this for the rest of the day, Bis alongside them. When they had finished one basket of reeds, she left and returned a few moments later with another. By the end of the day Suari's back ached and her fingers were bloody. None of the others said anything though, so Suari didn't either.

"You did good work today," said Bis begrudgingly. She took them to the roof to watch the suns set.

That night the three new children stayed. They seemed different from the ones who had left the palace with Suari. Perhaps they were just older. They had talked to each other, and to Bis, the whole time they were cutting reeds, but Suari had been so focused on the new task that she wasn't paying attention.

As they settled down to sleep, one whispered to her from the the floor nearby. "Pssst. What's your name?"

Suari rolled over to see who had spoken, somewhat taken aback to be addressed by anyone but Eliah for the first time in a long time. The boy wore baggy adult clothes, all bunched up and tied in knots to make them fit, and a floppy hat that he had kept on all day and still wore now as he lay on the floor. Long, chaotic bunches of dark hair stuck out from underneath it.

"Sabbo," she said. "What's yours?"

"Call me Sandy," the kid winked.

"Sandy!" Suari laughed a little. She hadn't done that in a while and it took her by surprise. "That's not a real name!"

"It is and it's my name! Sabbo isn't a real name."

"Where do you come from?"

Sandy cocked his head at the question. "Here," he waved his hand. "Where else?"

"From the city?"

"Where else?" He said again. "Hey, you're not very good at stripping reeds."

"I never did it before," Suari was unabashed. "Did you?"

"Every day. Never up here though! Up here is nice! Do you live here?"

"I guess so. Are you staying?"

Sandy shrugged, sighed and lay back. "Maybe for a while. It's more comfortable than down there."

"Goodnight Sandy," said Suari, drifting into slumber. She didn't hear his reply.

The next day Bis didn't come back, but someone had brought more baskets of reeds. Sandy taught Suari a better way to hold her knife so she wouldn't hurt herself so much, and she got faster at peeling and slicing the reeds.

"Don't go too fast though," he advised with a wink. "Or you'll just have to do even more."

Eliah brought food that day, and seemed pleased that Suari and Sandy were talking together. The other two older children tried to engage the silent ones but weren't having much luck it seemed.

Once the matter of the reeds was taken care of, they could turn their minds to other things while they worked. Suari started asking Sandy questions about the city. He was surprised to be talking to someone who had never been out into it before, but didn't ask her why.
